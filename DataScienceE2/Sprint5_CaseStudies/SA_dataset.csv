I cannot open the app anymore
I have been begging for a refund from this app for over a month and nobody is replying me
Very costly for the premium version (approx Indian Rupees 910 per year). Better to download the premium version of this app from apkmos website and use it. Microsoft to do list app is far more better.

It has changed how I viewed my different lists. Now they are all jumbled together and I can't find what I need.
How do to stop monthly payment because i don't use this app anymore
Horrible app. It doesn't do as described. Absolutely no support!
Did not realize there was a charge for this app do not want this app.
Downloaded first thing it trys to do is do a con. Not impressed.
No longer works with Alexa. What happened??
it doesn't show any list
Do not download
This app is not what I wanted at all.
Unnecessary pop up. Really annoying and counterproductive
They recently started sending spammy notifications every week or so. Please stop.
7 days for free and then you pay. Plus too complicated for some simple tasks
Update: thanks for your response. I would ask the developers to check their own app. There is NO monthly subscription option in the app. Old review: No monthly subscriptions? Why should I be forced to subscribe for a year? I am definitely not subscribing for a year in one go. This is ridiculously desperate.
Expensive paywall preventing access to features in wanting to try out
Worst application no task information on screen
I am not providing email addresses or google or Facebook accounts for a todo list
Uninstalled it as soon as it started sending me Ad notifications. Why does any developer think this is acceptable? Disgusting.
I have subscribed and have been charged for the whole year. Though no features of premium appeared. Can someone clarify the reason????
Have to pay premium if you want to put multiple reminders a day
Prayer Ubde
such a useless and greedy app only wants money as is chargeable after 7 days do you have shame i want to give you 0 star
Yes i what
Waste
Was charged for the year instead of monthly
Will not enable me to unsubscribe!
Dindigul
Latest update deleted all my tasks and lists! Have to start all over and try to remember what my list items were. I'll be looking for a new app.
Features for the free version are just disappointing.
Locking basic features behind a paywall is kinda weird
Soo awkward i can't able to sign *up* 😭 Sick app
Hangs when setting up Google Assistant
Subscription?? How does this application figure that it can be a subscription application? Ridiculous Update after developer response: This is not a subscription application. You are not Netflix or Adobe. This should be a standalone app quit trying to milk people's money. You can say anything you want. THIS WILL NEVER BE A SUBSCRIPTION APPLICATION. STOP BEING RIDICULOUS.
good
Duplicates files attached and you have to constantly delete. FIX THE BUGS.
Used to work so well earlier. Now it doesn't work at all!! Junk!!
Frustrating. Apparently its meant to sync grocery lists with Google home but doesn't. Absolutely no info on how to set it up
Too complicated to use
Forced sign in
Work on it
"I should have looked through ""most recent"" instead of ""most relevant"" reviews. It's far too limited for me in it's free state and I'm not interested in paying for a subscription just to unlock what should be basic functionality in a to do list app."
do not for showing or refund&refuse about my persional privacy.
"It doesn't have sub lists, e.g. ""child/school"", ""child/health"" so you see too many lists or too many tasks at once (which is overwelming)."
Not usefull and even they charge some money :)
This app is absolutely useless. Because of this i missed an important event because the reminder alarm supposedly forgot to rang. Its pathetic and useless.
Is the app or web platform down today? Can't seem to login either.
Have to pay for daily reminders... My phone does that free
The app is amazing - but the vibrations! So annoying!! Pls let me turn them off.
Dipak day Cox
Very bad
Location reminders don't work in medium power saving mode.. And all I got in reply was a copy paste solution and a trouble shoot link.
Fed up with interruption in each matter I note. Not worth the while HAVING there are far too many condescending workers out inte cyber world who refuse to take no for an answer.
Thanks to your stupid update I lost ALL of my appointment dates... Terrible garbage.
Was great but can't connect with other people since last update. Invite will go out and will even receive the invitation but doesn't link and have had no luck with customer support
I WAS TRYING FOR DAYS TO UN SUBSCRIBE. BUT OF COURSE THAT I was charged. Absolutely no support. Horrible and disgusting tactics
"Update ruined app Last update re-formatted the ""Plan My Day"" function so the ability to schedule tasks for that day or postpone into the future is unusable, so I have 50+ tasks and to way to arrange them into a comprehensive order. Contacted the developer who emailed me back after 4 days asking for a screenshot of the problem, so I sent it right back. 3 days later - no response from the developer, no fix, nothing. Update9/8: no fix, moved to aCalTasks +"
👎
You need an account because they want to track your cookies for ads
Need to create an account to use it.
Very bad
Pratz
i sent an ivite to people and everyone got over 50 emails for the one invite. What a joke of a an app.
I have to sync whatttt gtfohhhhhh
Bring back my money! Why your system stolen my money from pending subscribe? Without confirmation and notification!!!! Wheres my money???
WHY IS THIS SO BUGGY NOW? WHY ARE YOU NO LONGER REALLY BEING ATTENTIVE TO QUALITY CONTROL? CANT DELETE TASK ON ONE TRY. CAN NO LONGER DELETE FINISHED TASKS WITHOUT SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. ALL COMMANDS ARE HESITANT. ALL COMMANDS REQUIRE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. I HAVE EMAILED YOU 3 TIMES WITH NO RESPONSE. PLEASE ADVISE.

Makes simple things extremely complicated
Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.
The latest update now not working fine at all. It's worsening day by day. The developers now appears to have a different intention that premium paid version is purchased by the users.
Just use your basic phone calendar
I want to cancel the subscription.
MoneyGrabber Wants you to pay premium to choose specific dates.
Does not do much different than Google tasks (which is easier to use and is free). As a result I wanted a refund as I only realized this after my 7 day trial. Refunds are only given within 24 hours of their drawing their fee. Not sure that is legal for an automatic subscription after app trial.
Useless app... Set up 8 reminders during a course of 4 days and not once received any notification! Waste of money.
Subscription!!!
It syncs EVERYTHING. terrible. you have to get the pro version in order to be able to do anything actually worth while!!!
I don't found usefulness
Its a good app but the app keeps crashing when i allow this app to add to my calendar. After adding it to calendar then yhis app doesnt open. Keeps crashing
You have to open an account with them. I won't be going there. Would be nice to be given the choice.
Efvig
Sorry way to complicated. And why would you think I want my information out on your servers? Wanted to create a weekday event spent more time trying to figure out how to do that than it took to write in a diary.
Super
Worked great for a few years and then the past couple of months it eats anything added to the list! I can sit and watch things drop off before my very eyes!
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!!
Delete application
Laggy responses to resolved items and errors in recurring reminders
Nice app
No new it's repeated app
It stop working and I try to reinstall it but same problem
Atleast make a few features available .. if the customer donot like the app at initial stage than how would he/she ever think about going premium
Did not sign up. App not even on my phone. This payment deduction will be reported and I request you refund my money immediately.
Autofill on Android 10 does not work
Have have to make an account in order to use this app. There is no way around it.
Stop Adding Groceries Items Like an Ad
Bakwas app
Good improvements but still don't have nag or presisitent reminders. I missing a lot reminders accidentally
Having to pay to set a recurring task is ridiculous and essentially makes the app useless to anyone who doesn't want to pay so this essentially is not a free app.
There is some issue in payment.
Too complicated. I need a plan to plan tasks.
Everything it expects you to pay
Too many features locked behind premium.
Worst app
Not good
"Is it necessary to sign up account? While making a new account it's shows error ""oops try again later"""
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now
Have to pay for recurrent daily task.. which is the main purpose of that app.
Raben nat s7
First thing that happened upon opening is asking for payment. Good job.
"Unable to register with an email. Clicking""continue with email"" will just take you to a login page. Complete waste of time. I searched them first three pages of Google for a solution and found nothing. Found no solution on their help section. I don't want to register with Facebook or Google. If you include a feature, make sure it actually works."
"Any.Forget... Had an instance of daily repeating event, that I have marked as complete today and somehow it did skip the next day and only proceeded to the day after. Kind of ""daily event with some days skipped"". So useless to me as can't be trusted for notifying about daily routine tasks. P.S. don't tell me I don't know how to setup a recurring event!!"
Very slow app it took me 10 min just to start the app....
Anydo
I could not have any expirions about this app
Terrible App. Don't waste your money.
I couldn't use it
Looks like a pretty good app but it doesn't sync with Alexa. Which is the main reason I installed it. Shouldn't be this difficult.
Hf
Most useless app ever used! Very difficult to save anything or find anything! Put some tasks didn't get any reminders so didn't do it! Erasing this nonsense Can't even save this review
Its a great app but I dont receive any events notification although I have allowed the notification to come through from this app. I really don't understand why because I have set everything correctly.
Virender.kumar
Useless
Price is high
"Under subtitle *security* ""However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers"" Sorry no thanks.i just downloaded but after reading privacy policy i prefer going thru •Google official •one & app like calendar required lot of access ,&i personally don't wanna bleach my data like this..btw the tq for placing the info it to let us know :)"
Bad app
Tried doing all the settings as per ur guidence.. but app is not supporting popups in lock screen.. everytime I have to unlock my screen to check the event..
KimHong
I hate this app 😡😤😤 as soon as I downloaded it my phone was hanging 😠😠😠😡😠😡 😠
This app has Malware.
Not Making an Account!
I dont know..why people appreciate this app..not user friendly...
Time setting is so dumb. Fix it
SWEETY SWEETY Kumari
Not working
No integration with created Alexa Lists.
You have to pay for all the decent features... There's nothing you want to do that your alarm doesn't already do
can't open
Hopeless
I dont understand how it works. Not very clear on how to use it. And it comstantly showed notifications for anything i made a note of
Do not have option to not connect to fb google or email
"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice."
Please Add UPI feature because I tried many debit cards to get the Premium Versionof this app but any of them was accepted.
Lost all my lists when I was forced to give email address. Was good prior to having to start all over.
Rare
Good app but I wish there was a monthly payment option for premium instead of annual.
Pushing to hard for premium upgrade. Not interested anymore
Whapp integration is bad. Barely anything works. Focus to whapp integration and seeya again
no repeat alarm
Confused
I like this apps but the thing is anything need to pay? So sorry to do list i only gave it 2 star and its so bad 😔
Star
Its ok i guess
"App shouldn't enforce sign in for use. Uninstalled. Waste of time. Edit: that sounds like optional functionality for an app labeled to do list! Not a complete blocker to using the app. For a simple ""I need to make a quick note to remind myself of later"" this isn't very good."
Not what is expected
Perhaps the least user friendly app on Playstore. My head is spinning. Why is it so hard to edit the time of reminder?
The last update removed grid view and left us with a very odd task interface.
This is not free. Paid one. Some features are limited till paid.
App is good & I am using it since 6 months now BUT NOW A DAYS AUTOMATICALLY SHUTDOWN WHOLE WORKING
Got into the help menu by accident. Can't get back to my lists.
I have bought it yet it displays ERROR IN VERIFYING MY WHATSAPP INTEGRATION 😡😡😡😡
Ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if I'm not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one
Constant prompts for trials and upgrades. Super annoying.
"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app."
I'm experiencing issues with the reminder option. Whenever I set a reminder I get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things. This issue wasn't there before. What can be done to solve this?
Rimnder alram ka bhi option h ya nhi
Loved this app but I prefer writing things down
Ordinary updates delete reminders
Why pay for such simplicity?
Why so expensive? Microsoft Task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has. Could you please decrease the price a little bit? Or give me some discount? Atleast for the first Year?
Can't repeat task at custom intervals
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features."
Used to be good but now doesn't even notify me (and yes this is with the settings amended accordingly)
i liked it because of plan a tree cz i really needed it but it's expensive soo.. k bye
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.
LAGGIN! cannot open. Tq
Recurring reminders are available for free in Google reminder. You can't Monetize the basic functions.
For me it frequently stops syncing. I currently can't get it working again. But when it was working it was great.
Doesnt work on windows
not user friendly.
Used to love this app. After the latest update its garbage! Can't turn off the automatic date/time thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time. Will hang onto it for a bit in hopes that a new update will fix this issue. Or at least give the option to turn it off.
I love using this app however when I installed it to one of my phones I cannot login to it. It just keeps closing. I don't know what's wrong. Also I wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks.
Not yet solved. Cannot log in
useless
It can't adjust tasks with real-time line.
I actually love this and have use this for a year but the new update is no good at all that I need to edit my review due to the changes...
"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess."
Free version is very limited compared to Ticktick and Microsoft To Do.
"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this."
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff
a mess of features that don't serve me; cumbersome UX
I have cancelled my subscription. An amount of Rs. 909.90 has been deducted from my account. Kindly refund the same. I'm not interested in the app
"Lost another star for your reply to my previous comment. I like the ""moment"" notification. I like planning my day.. i hate the dumb sounds I can't turn off for every item I snooze."
Not free
Important features locked behind a pay wall.
A suspicious app! Do not recommend this application.
Keep losing mini steps after I write them down.
Estou tendo dificuldades com alguns bugs..
There is a issue with Notes. For as long as I can remeber you sometimes add a note and it's gone later. I keep having to go out and come back each time I add one in hope it's saved.
I like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing ... it's imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee.. they justify it by saying it's a service blabla it's an to do app. More people would actually pay for it if it wouldn't be a subscription model.
Nice polished but useless. There is no filter for tags. Web and app synch problems happens missing tasks. Not any scoring system. May good for amateurs but not for project managers. However I like the calendar view.
There are certain things I love like the fact that it sorts my grocery list by aisle automatically. But overall this app stresses me out. I just want an app that allows me to share my grocery list. But the grocery list seems buried in an area that isn't intuitive. I don't need something to schedule every second of my life which seems to be more this apps aim.
You reaaallllyyy don't have a lot without paying
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.
Premium version only
Weak and underdeveloped platform. Don't expect support to treat you like a person - this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you.
Missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items!!!
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.
"NEW: Great concept but NOT for confidential data because it's not encrypted (nor PW protected on phone or PC) and, one day, Any.Do company will get hacked & ALL your stuff be be out there, like EquiFax. RESOLVED: App loses your work. eg: I created a new task, started a ""notes"" section, pasted it in some material and clicked save. Then I went to another app to get more material but when I returned to any.do, my notes were GONE!. Your ""save"" button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked!"
Nested can be improved
It's a fine app but logs me out every other time I go to use it.
Recurring tasks are behind a pay wall. Ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature App is a little ugly and not customisable.
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.
Strange thing. When I mark recurrent tasks as done in web desktop version into the Upcoming section.
Notification is now pathetic.. shame. I liked it a lot. I think its time to jump ship. It's been fun.
After all this time you still can not search tasks on Android. So you have to look through every task you have created and through each list to find what task you are looking for. Going down to 2 star.
Not free
No monthly recurring reminder features. Can't even remind me when to pay the bills!
Have to create an account just to check out functionality. Don't want to do that. Uninstalling.
How do i unsubscribe this useless app?
Update: Used to be great. Now they've added so many steps it's no longer the simple app it used to be. Very disappointed.
Uninstalled after latest update and it blocked all my lists until I set up an account. No thanks.
"The ""not completed"" tasks do not carry over to the next day automatically. I wanted an app that would constantly flash incomplete tasks in my home screen. Otherwise, presentation of the app is good."
I dont liek it rlly
Premium version is too much expensive. Any.do should provide an option in which we can select max. 3 to 5 apps for integration in premium version & pay accordingly.
Well designed and all however alot of the crutial features are locked behind the premium which u need to pay for
Unable to edit time for reminder. S7
Cant really set custom remindere. For example I need to be able to check a specific system every 3 hours with other variables.. Cant do it
I want to discontinue and it was monthly base they charge me yearly it's very sad pls help and refund
No dark theme without a premium subscription? Ok
Looks like a copy of an IPhone app. Im not impressed by the huge bar in the bottom or the single colored ui. A night mode should come standard
There is no sound
"Too much spam. Stuff that I don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders I wanted the app for. Also, too many emails. I don't want more clutter to ""organize"" my life."
Very productive
I dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service
Not a great user interface. Have been using for almost 2 months but still struggling
Hate subscription uninstalled
Does this app work without internet connection also?
gaada waktu kapan harus selesai.. jadi kurang detail
Over all good task manager. But I do not like misleading and untrue boasts about integration with MS outlook. It is possible but only via zappier plus functionality is limited. Not possible to sync task between this 2apps.
Good until it started wanting money for doing its job
Downloads the app but package file is invalid error pops up before completing installation
So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.
"Ah yes, wanna use an ""advanced"" calendar? Well, turns out you must have an account for that. What's that, your eyes are burning under this bright theme? Well we have a solution just for you! As you have seen in our tips, you can change the theme. Oh W O P S, NO YOU CAN'T, how silly of us to not tell you in tips that ~BUY OUR PREMIUM!!!~... //Maybe it's just not what I was looking for..."
There should be a dark mode instead of setting through a premium theme option
Many times I've put sub tasks on my to-do tasks and they just disappear for some reason. I've forgotten many things because of this and still hasn't been fixed despite various updates.
App not bad but very limited unless you pay. Downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's WhatsApp integration. That is only available if you pay. Without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app.
Questionable experience. Upgraded to premium but WhatsApp integration is not working. Seems a little confusing.
Zero features in free version.
I can not figure out how to get it on my galaxy watch...ugh.
I was given this premium app. Now with new versions is not updating. I fail to understand this. If I'm given premium version then now why wouldn't it get updated? If it was non upgradable then why was it given? It's a great app and so it hurts when there are such tricks used on customers.
"Useful as a to-do list. Sets a real annoying ""plan your day"" popup reminder every morning. How you disable it is non obvious. Uninstalled."
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!"
Reminder feature is not working 🥱
I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.
I used to love it. It was my go to app for many years. But over the time it is losing the special status. It doesn't have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times. They removed that!
Good app. Annoying pop up every morning on my phone even though I have the notification turned off.
I haven't used they made an effort from there side. I'm a bit of a mess and I need time.
"29.9. Nothing new, I've already reconciled to that ""improved"" GUI. // 16.7.20, 3.8.19: No, a long time ago I was able to create a FULL (WITH a reminder) task in a LANDSCAPE mode. It's impossible now (after that 'redesign'). // 17.7., 2.3.: I'm pretty sure I WAS ABLE to create/edit a new task in ONE go (and in LANDSCAPE). It takes MORE moves now. // 2.2.2019: I CANNOT believe that when I HAVE got to change a grip from PORTAIT to LANDSCAPE when creating / editing a task it is more effective than before..."
"Some features just don't work in the free app! I have tried to set a daily reminder for 9am to put a ticket in my car. Once I click ""Done"", it sets the reminder the next day.... at 1am. I dismissed the 1am reminder once, half asleep as the sound woke me up, it never reminded me again and now I have a parking fine to pay. I have real memory difficulties and need an app that actually works properly! Disappointing, as I find the one off reminders really helpful."
I am not sure who want to pay monthly fee for a to-do list app. One time payment always make a sense.
Features are all right. It doesn't seem to me like they actually USE their own product. Else the idiosyncrasies would have been ironed out.
Didn't like
"Now able to see list view from widget thanks to developer response - but there's a new bigger problem now. The integration with Google Assistant is going terribly. Everytime I try to add an item to my grocery list through Google Assistant, Any.do creates a new list called ""Grocery"". When I ask what's on my grocery list, it replies ""you have 3 lists named Grocery, which would you like?"""
It was awesome at first. Then I try to add an event from the widget and it won't do it correctly. Super frustrated
"The Next 7 Days is No Longer Showing ""the next 7 days"" but rather group by lists and not by days.."
I pay for the premium app and it keeps closing down on me once Im in the app. What can I do to keep that from happening?
Almost perfect app just one thing I wish anydo had is hourly reminders and copy reminders to set the same task just a different time... This is coming from a PAID subscriber...
What happened to the missed calls notification? I recently switched phones and had to download the new version and the option is no longer there. It was one of the main reasons I used the app.
"To be fair, I downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes. The reason for this is that I hate apps that scream ""pay me money"" since the instance you download it, and this one did that exactly. With the ""free premium trial"" being in your face all the time, and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is ""premium"". Just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it. It looks amazing though."
Love it. Great future.👪🙌
So nice
fantastic
Too many options and gets too fancy for an app that should just have simple functionality to setup reminders and to do items
Way too expensive; if there was a monthly option I may consider going premium.
Great UI an reminder app. Only downside is I cant mute notifications for certain accounts which is really annoying. I'd like to see my events but not have notifications for them as I have a ton.
Just not for me. They also seem to refuse to let you delete your account by refusing a password that was created 15 seconds. Lots of cool features but not what I'm looking for.
Reporting abuse.
good
I like it true
Hyyy
Any Do Moments are not working for me.. 😪 Please look into it.
Don't know
It went from simple and useful to cool and confusing this morning. I don't know what is going on. I'm disturbed
We need a monthly payment terms. Currently it is yearly only!!
mobile app isn't very intuitive but the desktop app is good
"All around amazing life improver with one irritating caveat. The reordering functionality could really use some work. Often the reordering fails and the task gets thrown out of ""Today"" into ""Someday"" which means I have to go fish it out from a long list. Sometimes this will happen multiple times in a row really testing my patience. Been dealing with it for many months now - want to continue using this awesome app but really struggling with this one bug. Galaxy S9+, Android 10, One UI 2.1"
The day ended and i didnt end my task and it didnt shift or alarm about undone tasks
It's not what i need
It had a peculiar issue.. I have set it up to remind me of my ask with on screen notification but often it fails to do so and then I miss the task.
This is so frustrating!!! I set a event for someone's birthday then a event a month ago before the birthday to not forget to buy the stuff they want and nothing shows up! Nvm it shows up on my Google calendar
Don't have a monthly plan. I can't find it in the premium section
Well I have suggestion make a system where students could track time... Like total available time then distribute it over task..
Not pleased
I love the widget but whenever I edit an event on the calendar it changes the day to like the day before without me doing so and it's extremely annoying
How to get the pop up for missing call alerts
"The latest app update (7/26/20), ""new app navigation..."" is a definite downgrade, from panes to a one side scroll, now I can no longer see full task list names, the ""all tasks"" option is changed, the new layout sucks. Why do developers always do this, ""fix"" things that aren't broken? Why can't you just improve the things people are requesting, instead of changing everything else around too? This ver is much harder/inconvenient to navigate than the previous one was. Trying to revert to older."
Don't like the app and trying to unsubscribe but there is no option
Can't import/sync w/ Google Tasks?
The daily reminder does not work i mean it works on the first day but than on the next day it does not make sounds or pop up when its to do the task
Problem with the notification. Can't complete task from notification. Keep showing till I mark task as finished that too by opening the app.
Sir i have deleted this app i cant understand how to do so that the reason please reset my google account from any do and donot charge after 7 day trial
Literally half the features under premium can be found free with other apps.
It's ok
How to connect with Yahoo mail
Needs smart dictation like todoist and better calendar widgets like ticktick
Needs work. Time options in Custom ARE NOT Professional enough.
Can't move it to SD card. I need space on my phone so I'll likely be deleting it.
Review more for 5 stars!
I paid for premium account. But my account status is still free with no premium feature.
I really want to like this app. We use it to share shopping lists. But the syncing with my wife's phone leaves much to be desired.
I am on premium and i don't receive whatsapp messages as reminders
Add features like todoist
Ok
You have to pay to get half the features
Very limited without premium
Best GUI with few bugs
I left a review earlier that was one star. While the app wasn't for me (I found that it was confusing and didn't suit my needs so I deleted it shortly after) The customer service was fantastic. I was charged for a subscription even though I didn't use the app because I made a mistake in canceling the subscription. I sent an email detailing my problem and asking for a refund. The response was quick and a refund was granted I thought it was only fair to come back and leave a nicer review.
I just downloaded the app not quite long. I've started to enjoy it but there's one problem. The widget is usually empty even though there are tasks in the app. What can I do about it?
برنامه عالیه اما اکثر امکاناتش پولیه
Nice
Very handy if you're going shopping or need reminders on what you want to purchase. Easy to use and plenty of features.
I really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me.
Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.
Its okay so far but im not sure on how to find the focusing tree part in order for me to stay focused just wondering how you do it other than that not too bad of an app
It is not working
LIKE
I want to use this app but i can't do log in. Many times i uninstall and reinstall but prb is still not solved
I believe I am rating about getting back on engine browser and phone after batteries or devices cannot interface
Tried it. The app worked well but found something that works better for me personally..🙃
Not so good
This site is most suitable for those who wanted to get a jobs from home Thanks a lot
Great app. But I am not getting notifications even when i set time to remind
Going for free and better Microsoft To-do
So far I'm not impressed and I don't see where it's worth over $40 a year to use... I'm really trying to use it for everything since I did pay for it but to me it's just not worth it.
Not bad
Will not let me start the free trial or for that matter purchase an upgrade so for now since it's stuck like me 3. Get it fixed and I'll improve score.
Delet
Thank you 😊
Features available in many apps for free are paid here...
I would normally give this 5 stars but the past few days the widget has not allowed me to make tasks on future dates. It just puts the task on todays date. And you cant put tasks on random future days either. Tomorrow yes but i like to plan ahead of tomorrow
Super
don't understand collaborative editing
Not very user-friendly. I found it hard to navigate and find what I wanted. It works nicely and I appreciate the simple art style.
How do u change it to am or pm because I can't press it and the time is really important
Can't edit the time of a scheduled task and no sound/alarm notifications for the tasks. Edit- sound issue resolved. But still having issues with editing tasks. Not a very user friendly interface.

Great app and does what I want it to do. (Is my prefered habit tracker ) However I believe the colours should not be a premium feature. Far too expensive as it is the only reason I would get premium! Perhaps make adding wallpapers from gallery a premium feature?
Reminder sound not sounding
It is better than the normal app in your phone I only wish their was better support for the calendar
Need more user friendly interface. But very useful application my mobile.
Everything is great. But the sort by time isn't working properly.
I asked seven days trial to see whether I like or not and you have already taken the money for the whole entire year that is a rip-off
Tried to share a list with my husband but it won't share between my Office account and his Personal account. It's a show stopper.
All good. Should work on calendar
Love it!! But can't afford premium😞
"I have been using this app for years and previous update of ""next 7 days"" update is amazing. I usally plan my day in morning and use widget to view my today's tasks but now app widget shows tasks by category not by next 7 days which has created a serious issue for me. I highly recommend in widget show tasks by day wise list not by category wise otherwise for me and for many this app is useless."
1) It has a calendar feature but you can't customize the calendar events repetition as much as you can in google (can do daily but not 5 days a week all in one entry). 2) edit: figured the task sorting part out. Sort by time and collapse upcoming/tomorrow and it will just show your daily tasks. I like that. But it's still not worth paying for unless the calendar event customization is as good as Google's since that is free.
Very 👌 nice
Great app. but buggy. Keeps asking me to delete all completed tasks even though it's empty
Good
nice
Initial upgrade hid the separation of today tomorrow upcoming and someday. After sorting and adding new tasks all of sudden they all showed up again. Don't know why this happened. If these features go away it will make this app much harder to use. The bug freaked me out and cause me to write a very bad review which I have since edited and amended
Best app for ur task management. Edit: for 5 stars u can add more theme options for free version
Why notifications are too short? I want to be able custmize my noti sounds!!!
還算不錯用！簡單易操作
This is my best to do apps so far and I like it very much. I wish there are some tutorial to give some advice on how to use all the apps potential. And maybe some connection with google assistant and over voice command.
Dark theme should be free 😢
Have the free version and even that is quite useful in terms of ease of use and integration with calendars. Now thinking of upgrading. Could get a 5 then.
Good app
Like this a lot.
Locking option is not available..All other features are excellent.
Hh
Good
This rating is for the free version. Most feature rich free version I've tried of other to do list type apps. Interface takes some getting used to but great features and everything seems to be working.
It would be better if there's an icon beside the task so I can easily identify whether a task has some note to it.
So great. I have suggested this app to many a friend. Suggestion: have the ability to custom the repeat feature in the events. Sometimes things repeat every week but only for 5 weeks.
It's good app for all
I love it so far.
Great
I am using it daily
I really enjoy using the app but I want to suggest a daily summary of tasks to be done (in the morning) and tasks completed and those that were not. Thanks for your hard work.
I dont like that ths deleted or finished every day just let the incomplete ones roll over and the completed ones stay back
It is very nice app. It would be good if you could add due date option for tasks
A good app to remind me of things I need to do
Gr8
Excited
Very useful
Make dark theme available in the free app
Can I import my task list from Google keep app
Good
It would be better if there was a voice command like Alexa.
Thanks for the support. Battery optimiser on Xiaomi disables the autostart of the app. It works now
Has been super helpful in organising my days. Has made getting my chores sorted so easy
So far so good
Good
Nice App. Able to manage my tasks
I like this app. It helps me to accomplish my tasks very comfortably. A must have apps for productivity. Thank you
Decent app
It helps me to remember what to do as I forget sometimes. It's a nice application but there would be a slight change in it. There must be a ringtone to remember not any message. As people see calls not messages as my opinion.
Getting better with each up date.
App parfaite si vous voulez vous tenir à jour et savoir où vous en êtes avec vos tâches/missions. versions gratuite avec quelques publicités mais rien de vraiment méchant. A tester absolument !
Love it
Super
Any.Do moment new colored style isn't good.
This app was great a year or two ago. They spam you now with premium service purchase requests (which are costly) and have restricted all the good options to their premium service.
Help you alot to plan your day
Great app. I really like the integration with other apps like Gmail and Trello etc. My only problem is it sometimes doesn't show notifications.
Good app
It's great

Amazing app pretty good to remember you what you should do :3
Nice
Interesting but personally not needed.
Good app but eventually stopped using it as it didn't fit my needs exactly.
Ol
Will be happy if this app comes with time duration..other that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks
It has been very useful for me.
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.
Adding Habit Tracker would be useful.
Easy to use interface... Premium account links into other APPS
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?
99% percent love this app! I would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another. It's annoying to other people nearby when I'm using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day. Otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs.
Nice app foe reminder
Nice app very useful
Nice
Helpful app. Thanks for the good work.
The app lacks tools to view how good I am keeping up with my daily habit/recurring tasks.
Very nice
Great app but needs work.
Goood
Good
There's no search option for mobile version even I already have the latest version
So far so good. I just dont like the fact that it has payment to get full features and it's quite expensive.
Great
Great app for tracking tasks. Could use some work on gesture/finger detection. For example I will always accidentally close the text field for a new note when trying to hit save. Pro version is good but a little pricy for the benefits.
Its a very good app...the only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thing..it dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened. However i have already given all the notification rights. Dear any.do team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings. Thanks
Good note
So far this is the best app I have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want .I highly recommend you to try this app.
"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult."
This app really help me.😊
How to disable the everyday 9am reminder to keep a reminder? Honestly don't need it. That's just a noise!
No pop-up reminders because we use planner as we forget.
It helped me
Love this app.. But I wish i can add due date for my task.
Très pratique !
Very good app for manage the things. Easy to use.
I can hardly give up on this app. It is so intuitive even though there are still things to improve. 1-Shortcut to grocery list 2-Displaying time of the task in the widget
Its good and does the job
I started with the subscription primarily because of the NLP. Does it support recurring tasks with NLP ? The integrations are awsome!

Had an issue but it was handled right away.
Great
Great App for planning my day
It's simply the best 😁 ❤️
I just like this app for it's widget. I didn't pay for the full version so I uninstalled. I'm coming back because the widget look EXACTLY how I need it to look. I wish I could JUST install the widget honestly. It's my favorite.
Really useful and well designed app - only thing I feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget
Do i need to pay?
Great app! It makes my family and me do specific tasks. I would give it a 5 star review but sometimes the notification doesn't pop up at all.
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying
I m new to used
I think that a bug when I set tag for the goal they sometimes disappear
Nice
Timely
Simple and useful. Liked the widget too.

Nice app which reminds us our tasks and events

"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off."
Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??
UPDATE: Tags have started syncing back again. Tags do not sync between the mobile and desktop app. I am a premium user and I put in a ticket about the issue. After frequent back and forth over the email the issue hasn't been resolved yet. I will update my rating after the issue has been fixed.
"Integrates well with my work flow. I had difficulty in understanding the 'My Lists' so instead I ""listed"" My projects instead...works, now integrates well with what I do and the tags differentiates similar project ""lists"". I accidentally deleted my shopping list when I really wanted to remove some items...but its growing on me."
Is this a free app or have to subscribe (& pay) to use beyond 7 days?
Only one suggestion: an option for big tasks. Sometimes i have a big task that i will complete over multiple days and it would be cool to be able to check off a little bit at a time.
this is a good app
Great.. and i liked it more than todoist..
Best to do list apk I have ever used.
Alot of great features and cry informative and reminds you as well . Great for me thumbs 👍
Not always where it should be. does not always popup when set on samsung galaxy 9. very few aps rate 5 stars as very few have no problems at all. 5 stars woould say it works perfectly from my perspective.
It was perfect until the new update on Huawei P20 Lite. More precisely with the short cut (widget) on a main screen. Please sort this out. Thanks
I love this app Previous issue of being randomly logged out was resolved
Great app for managing your activities. Been using this for 3 years and it still meets my requirement in managing my to-do's
Great app. Love using daily
Feel good help me for rewind my task
A very good reminder app.
I love this app

I have never see such wonderful application before
good one..nit n clean ..liked it.
Plan my day should be free...
Sounds alittle hard and complicated to me Good app btw...
I was finally able to get this installed- yay! My husband also put it on his phone so we can share the grocery list and others. I've updated to 4 stars as it seems to be working now. Thanks! Can't get it to finish installing and I have plenty if room. Gets to 97% and then stops. I will revise my review if I ever get to try it!
This app is awesome. I am currently using the free version and it had everything I need. It truly makes it easy for you to stai organized and not lose tracks of priorities.
Great product
Good app 🙂👍
I like this app. It is the most simple and straight forward of its type that I've found.

Amazing and fantastic app❤️
Interesting
i like that app
Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!

Very useful aap. I am satisfied
Thanks a lot for the reply! It's working great again like before!! 😄😄 (Small suggestion: maybe make this fact more obvious from the app UI or provide sort order as an option for the widget 😀) Thanks again!
It's awesome. I've tried some other apps but didn't find as much productive as it.
ok
Very useful app. Thanks to the developers!
Great To do App
Encourages me to do more!
Love this app. Used it for years!
Amazing app! Just one suggestion please please add feature of setting time in subtasks as well. It would be a really great feature making the app more wholesale!!
This app is great! I'm able to use an online scheduling tool without having to pay for a subscription. Helps me stay on task at work.
This app gets better all the time. I'd be lost without it... And so easy to use!!
Awesome app the best

Forget everything and enjoy the life. Any.do will ensure you don't forget anything. It's really an excellent app to manage your everyday task so that you should not miss anything from your 'To Do' list. It's quite helpful in every day life. Thanks a lot.
Great to keep important things in front of me for a busy schedule. Love the option for when you can set each reminder for.
Cheap paid version... covers all u need to maintain a todo list

The 1st October update has an issue in widget. The repeated tasks remain on top despite you mark then done for today.

Possibly the best reminder app on the play store
You wont steal my information right?
Just what I needed! It's a big help for organising tasks and setting reminders when I'm at work.
Great app to record and follow up for your daily activities
I really love it
I love this app
Wonderful experience in the free version itself . let's you organize your day and make it optimally productive

I've used a lot of task lists and this one is my favorite. It is so flexible and I can use it for all areas in my life.
Awesome
Reminder isnt part of standard app. Needs upgrade
Reminders are a premium feature you have to pay for. This should be basic.
"I was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms, but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this. Come on Todoist! Reminders should never be a ""Premium Feature"" in a task management app!!!"
I was super happy to download this app but that I soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your to-do list
Not good
Why do I have to create an account and sign in for a simple to do app? Hella sus
No reminder options for free version of this app. How can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for. My alarm clock would be better than this app. Sorry I don't recommend.
Lack of reminder in free version
I don't liked becous it is not have the time in my tasks day 😭😧😩😢☹️🙄
I will increase one star each day it will help me achieve my goals.
Why is alarm feature premium? It's the most basic utility someone expects from a to-do app.
"PROBLEM WITH NEW UPDATE. Since the latest update, the app keeps crashing everytime I try to expand a task's subtasks using the built in ""down arrow"" button on the right side of the screen. PLEASE FIX."
Doesnt Nofication me
Requires sign in. Lol no.
This app is a joke They want you to pay for simple feature like reminder whats the purpose of free app then make it all paid
No reminder alert for free version.
Why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app.. what dev.. you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that. Ridiculous.. uninstalled.. just needed a to do list app as simple as that.
👎 notifications $
Not so great app apart from its natural language input. Only recently added kanban view but lacks any basic requirements like reminders in the free version. Also the android widget hangs almost always. Never gets updated.
Very bad app does not work
All functionality comes with premium account only... Shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version
Data-mining rubbish
"It is reliable. The app itself is great. I give one star for the price only. Condering my phone have ""reminder"" app that is free and built in. This app is really just ""burning"" my money. Thanks but no thanks."
Downloaded the app and added a bunch of items and a couple of categories. Opened it back up a few hours later and everything is gone.
ridiculously complicated
Spam
This app does not work on my smartwatch. I am not able to log in.
"Starting out this app was ok, but then I started noticing how limited this is for the free version. Only 10 projects, and where did my completed tasks go? Those should not disappear until I manually delete them. A week into using this, and the workflow I was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up. These are recurring tasks I do daily. I don't know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for ""daily"", but it's lame!"
doesn't actually store any notes
"I've tried a dozen+ task list apps in the last few days (and many before that), looking for certain features. I don't know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it (no ""skip login"" option). Nowhere did I see the creators/reviews say an account is required even for starting/basic use. One star: non-web, non-collab, non-premium features should be accessible without account. Then I finally read 1- star reviews, now glad I didn't sign up: apparently the spam emails never cease."
Worst most useless app I've had the misfortune to try. Literally zero point in having this over Google calendar. Don't waste your space. It's useless. You can't have recurring tasks& everything is behind a pay wall. Avoid.
NOBODY IS RESPONDING TO MY SUPPORT EMAIL IT HAS BEEN DAYS WHAT IS THIS? I NEED HELP ALL MY INFO IS GONE AND NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING FOR DAAAAYYSSSSSS
Everything was a purchase immediately after downloading. Bummer
"Fighting the input method rather than getting stuff done. ""Natural language"" will no way allow me to set a task called ""Register for 3 Oct SAT test"" for this Friday. Something simple as adding a note requires Premium. I'm going back to ToDo"
Too expensive. Ticktick is better
Too complicated and not well organized
It started to send emails asking me to add go running or make coffee..I wanted a todo list that I could share with my wife..not another wife telling what I should be doing
App is not starting.. just showing blank black screen
Great app but the fact I can't see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if I'm free on specific day in the future insteas I need to check week by week is a deal breaker although I did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible. Will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app.
This app let's you create 1 list then when you go to create the next one you can't without paying.
Cannot delete account. Tired of getting email notification everyday. Worst app ever
It is the worst app in my life .!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!
Charges for service not received. Can not contact
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list
Worst only useful when you are using premium
Too complicated so uninstalled but still getting unasked for and annoying emails every day.
you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib .
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it"
Not really usefull too difficult to use
Bad reviews are a real turn off for me.
What good is a task management app if it cannot give reminders
Without paid membership there was no use of this app.. so guys don't download it.
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634
👎
I deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday! Its a waist of time anyway
REMINDERS are a PREMIUM FEATURE in a TO-DO APP? Really????
Every thing is for premium users!
Required me to sign in to use it? Pass.
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service.

"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task."
I need to pay just to use reminder damn never using this app again so money hungry.
No options to repeat a task. Why else would i want a to do list? Might as well use a pen and paper.
No Reminder option. Why u showcase it in ad when it's a paid service?
Have to pay $4/mo if you want the reminders to work. I have ADD. The reminders are the #1 thing I need in a to-do list!
Can't work effectively on the free version
You create good think bt every option you when i use just close it and subscription to much price 350 par month os is really....
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled."
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help
I dont need my card to set the reminder
it is impossible uninstall this one
Reminders is a paid feature. What a joke.
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders
Subscription for reminders $5. Well it's fine I will move to Google Tasks.
Worst
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid
Baad
Many features are available just for premium
Garbage
Time reminder available to to premium only ..??? Really !!! 🤬🤬🤬 pretty desperate to earn some bucks .
Reminders are behind a paywall
Used to be affordable. Now more expensive than US pricing!
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality."
Boring
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.
Everything included in premium feature . Only frame work is there.
Widget not loading?!?
No notification on free version ☹️
It disturbs when they send unnecessary e-mails
I dont like this
Basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!
Everything behind a pay wall...
"Reminders, the most basic of features, is ""premium"" in this app."
"""reminders are a paid feature"" That's one of the most basic feature of a to do app!! Why even bother to have a free version? THIS IS STRICTLY A PAID APP."
There are no recurrent feature. Reminders feature is premium.
After the latest update I cannot find a way to sort my All list by due date any more. Thus the app is now useless to me.
everything is premium 🐸
Requires account. It's free because they make money harvesting your data.
Once again you've made this worse by redesigning the widget. It was fine as it was. Now I can't select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item. If this carries on I'm definitely not renewing my subscription. Please restore
"""Reminders are a premium feature"""
"Update 04.2020 - this is getting worse and worse still, with every update. Now they made it harder to edit your task - they moved it behind two clicks. Why?? Seems like this app is moving away from the todo-app for power users to just another todo app, same as any other. This is the last time I paid for the premium subscription. Time to move. ----- It used to be the best for power users, but after the latest ""updates"", the app keeps getting worse and worse. I am not really sure who this updates are for, definitely doesn't seem like it's for its core user group."
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.
Anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless. Uninstalled.
I want to schedule a task daily ! Should I add it every day ?! What's the way ??
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling."
Good
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app
I will use other app. I will not pay
Not easy to use. Horrible design.
Needs registration. Can't use existing caldav task accounts
In basic app why can't even add comment its not even basic when it comes to free.
$36 per year for push notification reminders? No thanks.
Requires my email? No thanks.
The Google Calendar integration is riddled with bugs and it has been this way for months. They don't fix it and they are pretty slow on their communication. TickTick is becoming very tempting.
Pay to remind??? Really???
Total waste of money.
not convenient for users
Reminder is under premium! Seriously! Must need unstall
Not helpful
If paid account bit costly
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.
No reminders in free version. And pro version is very costly. They should lower their prices according to PPP. Todo list without reminders is useless. I can use any notepad app instead of free version of todoist.
Everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it. A simple push notification and you want me to pay for it.
"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?"
Reminder is chargeable service . No point
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...
"Earlier it was an excellent app without premiums on reminders and many-many other stuff, literally everything was available. But with time it got only worse, these complicated swipes, circles instead of checklists, and ""modern"" trendy design while neglecting intuituve and easy style. And now what I see, after a year? Everything got even worse. What happened with you?"
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit."
Most of it's premium.
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.
Too complex
A lot of functionality but not so simple to use
That app is good but I could not benifit
Almost no productivity without premium version.
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.
Everything is premium
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes todoist and chome :( :( :("
Sort by priority is missing
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list...."
Paywall heavy
I realy didn't like titack is better to me.
Disappointing...
Cost$$$$$$
You need to pay to add reminder/alarm which should be a basic feature
Did I read that right? To add reminders to my tasks will cost me £36 per year? Are you crazy?
Simple function like sort by name isn't working. Shame.
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.
Only for singlr use.. cant assign task and sub task to others
Y.
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue."
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist."
Not flexible enough for my needs
So you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium? NO still doing normal in everything else
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article 😡😡😡? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.
The new update destroyed the widget. Terrible.
"--- EDIT: there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date: ""tomorrow"" is sometimes sent to next week and ""next week"" the week after. I double checked my datetime settings. --- Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be happy to pay, but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered. At least not for my usage."
"They fixed the crashing issue. Awesome. My impression of the app was 5 stars after that. What brings me back though is the latest GUI change to the widget. 2 stars now. They took away the ability to easily select multiple tasks. I am considering switching task managers now. I do not see a way to restore the old functionality. Also I used to be able to launch ToDoist from the widget. That button is gone now too. I am a long time user. I've reached the """"enlightened"""" rating on the app. Boo..."
Too complex
Why would I pay for this app for reminders? It's just a goddamn simple feature!
Subscription required just to set a reminder.
Why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point.. You guys are just a company trying to get rich.
There are better options available. I just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app. I tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and I am going to try another.
Reminder requires payment
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions."
expensive
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.
The main feature does not work - it doesn't remind me about todo with system notification
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.
"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer. It was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option. But now I have to go through my hidden gift stash. Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time."
Not very user friendly.
Yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.
گزینه آندو ش میپره
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time)."
(Sep 2013) took almost 1 year for decent reminders. Is still annoying to click twice to view the notes. Not very productive! (Oct 2019) with new interface the notes disappeared. The interface is just a copy of Wunderlist or TickTick. What is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality (reminders and notes) for nothing?
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.
To many features locked behind premium
New layout and functionality is no bueno. Don't like the interface for rescheduling tasks. Please fix!!!
Gud
Would even pay & advertise but I am not able to see in one view WHEN future stuff is taking place...
why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date? i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date.. can this be fixed???
Versão Free não faz quase nada. Quase enganação falar que o app é gratuito
You can't have your to do list as notifications
"Kept getting ""an unknown error has occurred, please try again later"" .... Tried on several devices on my T3 connection, had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one. Uninstalled. Sad cuz it looked great. In re: dev's reply, yes I did that. I made sure it was plugged in and turned on too. I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks."
It just feel old...
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36€ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan
You have to upgrade to get notifications...
"Great app. Alas, I'm constantly reminded that ""Hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for : ) "". This is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense. Plus hey! Its expensive."
Tedious and annoying to use. Went back to using Google Keep.
cant make into my calendar
No longer able to add note to Todoist quickly using Google and Note-to-self. Yes you can do it but it takes 60 seconds instead of 10 seconds. Not sure if this is a Google change or a Todoist change but it removes one of the most useful parts on Todoist. I am a LONG TIME premium user looking for another tool.
"I used to like this app. Been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results. But it's been having too many problems with sync, and with failing to load ""Karma"" data. Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required."
why does my theme switch from dark to light every time i open the app?
use Google tasks instead
Too many premium features
Notifications don't sync without opening the app.
should tell the cost first
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.
Doesn't even come close to Wunderlist or Any.do unless you pay.
need to learn more
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!"
"""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Mit diesem kurzen Statement wurde ein Kernfeature der App einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten Workflow. Auf Nachfrage beim Support bestätigt dieser, dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann, ""wann genau"" ein ähnliches Feature dahingehend kommen wird. ""Generell zukünftig"" hieß es da nur. Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden. Siehe Oben."
Have to pay for labels. there's no separate sections for different categories on widget
very simple design that makes adding a task complex! also most useful features are premium.
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.
"Please I need help. When I try to log in with Google in the app, it said ""Unknown error occurred. Please check again in a few seconds"". I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but no such luck😢"
Wunderlist is much better
i never understand why they never update or upgrade thier bad subtask? working under 2 years (I am using premium account) and managed hundred projects which I seen this app to weak too continue. I cannot handle subtask and moving them together that is really problems but they never fixed. i think i will change another for next project. this is enough. thank you
it works. but WAY TOO EXPENSE and compkicated than most user will need. this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating.
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.
Mahal. Harus bayar mahal untuk bisa mendapatkan fitur2 penting
Really liked this app until they started charging for basic functions on a monthly basis...would have been happy with one time charge but not worth $36 a year when there is better for less...
The free version is very limited
reminder is a premium feature. really? the app isn't user friendly.
its an average app to waste time on and increasing your work
Looks good until you have to pay 3£/month to add labels
Free features are MUCH better in Wunderlist app and second best would be Any.do.
The free version has a minimal functionality. There more advanced free apps on the PlayStore.
The chrome extension is awesome but not the mobile app.
Limited features with the trail/free version !!
it's good to do stuff but it won't let me see the tasks I've completed
items/tasks disappear; Search is hard to use; Annoying user interface to enter due dates that require you to remember esoteric lexicon to do things like reoccurring dates.
Premium or nothing.
"Hi,  I am using Vivo V5 Plus handset. I had downloaded ""Todoist"" for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work, if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen.  Kindly help me in this regard."
I couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks.
puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly.
the only reason I had premium was because I could get SMS notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications. beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar.
"Worthless. Contacted ""support"" through the app over a week ago, and still no reply. I paid for the year, but I will be cancelling it, as paying to have basic features on this app is a ripoff for the customer. Crazy to think I paid and still get no support. Go with another app and save yourself the money an the hassle of Todoist. THANKS. UPDATE: THEY HAVE FINALLY REPLIED, SO UP TO 4 STARS, AS AT LEAST THEY GOT BANK TO ME."
You can't do almost anything without upgrading to premium.
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it."
There is better google keep than this if you need a free one. You need to pay to use this.
يحتاج بال رايق و معقد مو مثل ما اتوقعت وقت ثاني يمكن احمله
"Hi Can you add secondary filter, like currently you provide filter option priority 1, priority 2 etc. When we r using a filtered view like ""View all"" then all task priority 1 (from different projects) gets lined up sequentially. Here if suppose 15 task have Priority 1, 30 have priority 2 then it is difficult to sort. Can you please add secondary priority filter like SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 etc which we can assign to task and then u know we can see proper sorted view. Any timeline to add this feature?"
Full power app! Sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own. Otherwise amazing.
"For the love of god explain me why there's no option to always show the tasks I've done??? I don't want to go to the main tab to the submenu, like WHY can't I reach today's ""done"" tasks from today tab??? And no option to make them not hidden as soon as a tap it done."
There's no repeat task daily feature
When I open a project then click on the arrow drop-down the app closest otherwise I normally love the app.
I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom.
It won't notify me
It felt like too much
The free tier is close to useless and coming from Ticktick I found Todoist pricier and work fewer features.
App is great as a Wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money? It is not possible. Unfortunately i won't use this app.
How can I stop it from sending me the things I enter the app to my email?😐
Only one snooze option. I need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm. This is an option for just about every other todo app. Don't understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time??? Respone to developer: No it doesn't help. When an alert comes up I would like to be able to select how long to snooze that particular alert from a several options. Not one snooze length for.all alerts.
App crashes whenever I try to edit time of any task.
"Suddenly the filter ""no time"" no longer works. It used to work up to yesterday, but no longer does. Please fix."
OK... I waited a long time for this app to run in landscape mode on my Tablet. No dice reducing to 3 starts until this functionality is added. Sorry but I can't use this app 50% of the time. thanks
How to add everydays task
Why aren't reminders free >:'(
When we add sub-task it gets added too slow!
No integration with Google assistant. Will probably leave for more integration of hands free control.
"Some functions are frustrating. I was trying to enter tasks as theyre described in an assignment with things like part a, b, or c, but it always changed anything with a part ""a"" to a time. If I manually changed it so there was no time, it deleted the rest of the text."
NC
Its a nice app but to keep in mind your tasks it needs a notification but u have to pay for it thats what I hate in this app .coz it doesn't remind u that at what time u have to do a task it gets a little boring while this . sometimes I forget about my tasks
not that great
Reminders and some other features should have been free.
Базовый функционал платный.
Not bad but the best features of this app is contain credit
It reminds and keep systematic record of daily work
"I would rate it 4 or 5 star.. but it's just that the main features aren't free... Otherwise you can go for it.. It's an ""OKAY"" app."
I like it
Good
Too many clicks to do things. You need premium version for reminders
Im giving only 3 stars coz remainders are not working inspite doing all the troubleshooting methods posted in todoist help. Help me
Feedback
Why too many steps to remove a project?
Simple. Clear. Unobstrusive. But alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view.
Charging every task
An app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app
Good
"If I select ""sort by date"" I want it to be automatic. So I do not need to re-sort items if I mark task done or add new task."
Not bad
Still trying it out
Good
Shouldn't have to pay for reminders.
"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that."
Reasonably decent to-do list but the yearly fee is too high for what this product actually provides.
Ok. Not as easy to add a project after task has been entered. A little clunky moving task to next day.
More steps to go through to access lists that were immediately available on wunderlist
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us
Mainly making use of tasks. The sub tasks within make my day.
The new widget made the app almost unusable for me. Not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way.
Loved Todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me. Can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore.
It was essential to me until the last updates.
Not sure yet about other features but definitely need the ability to access the full app from the widget
I can no longer touch the widget to open the full app. What happened? I use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen.
Need notes option like Wunderlist has Get that and you'll get a 5 star I have the premium version and we want notes aswell as the chat please JUST LIKE WUNDERLIST
Nice app
It's pretty good so far. I'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps.
Please add app option to put new task at the TOP of the list for those that are coming from wunderlist.
Reminders should be available for all.
New to the app so still learning
Nice app but would like access to a calendar without paying premium price
Would be awesome if paid but free version too restricted it ain't worth it
Useful
Having some problems figuring out what all this app offers; still learning it.
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked
Repeating previous posts- don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium. It's just a shell not worth the space it requires.
"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform. The simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective, enjoyable, & my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured. It helped me greatly."
I wish more options be available to free version
App is good to use but it's premium so Not using now.
Great way to start to get organized!
Frustrating update plans.
There is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless I know the smart commands.
👍
Keeps me focused!! But I don't want to purchase anything. I think it could all be free in my opinion.
Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled."
Great app
Please provide undo and redo for all actions
Phone: Samsung Galaxy J7 Star I just started using the app. I'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly.
Good
"Very long time user. Latest updates are making things harder. Subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again. Example: I have a weekly todo titled ""Groceries"" with grocery items I need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task. Whereas before I could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when I go shopping again, it's now completely gone."
Not user friendly. Free version very limited.
Will this be available for computers soon?
Excellent
Would be 5 stars for sure except I can't add a task to the top of the list. It is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift. And they do know about the idea per the forums. Love everything else.
"Please add support to add a task at any position (something like ""add task below/above"" )this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version"
"Really like the app, but I've found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view, for some sections the tasks don't appear and the ""add another task"" button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position."
It is a great app. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications
This app helps me alot in tracking and managing my different jobs.
This is really helping me be organized.
Me esta gustando el sistema que usa
Simple and intuitive
The last update is a win! The new karma & productivity interface are top notch! Keep improving this already awesome app for eventually reaching the perfection! Update: Love the new black theme! This thing is beautiful! Keep it up!
Good view and easy to use
Intuitive and easy to use
It's a gr8 app. Very useful for daily planners. But i would suggest it to have even weekly as well as a monthly planner.
Helps keep your day on track
Its really good. But is there a way to create a task which repeats itself after certain period of time say every monday just like Google calendar
Amazing!
Really love the app. As it keep me on time and improved my productivity too.
It helps me keep up with daily chores. Having the reminder emails is a plus.
Good for tasks.
This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.
Simple. Intuitive. Effective.
Basic functions work all well. Good UI and sectionings of works. Will get you through the basic needs.
I like that everything I need to do is right in one app with a reminder! Loving it! It also allows lists withing the list you are making.
[Review update] It's a good thing I put my subscription renewal date in Todoist as a task because they don't send you any notification that your subscription is running out.
The date search doesn't work in Chinese. It understand Chinese date in a wrong way.
Pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added. I dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me.
"Хорошее приложение. Есть подзадачи, а время и дату напоминалке можно указывать текстом. Например, ""завтра в 20"""
Why editing task is so difficult. Intuitively I long press to edit but no response. Then I have to figure out here and there to find how to edit.
Pretty good so far
The automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes. It would also be nice to have a maps integration - I do not think it is there.
It's good but not perfect because I have same tasks everyday and the tasks I kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason I am switching to ticktick
good if u are a to do list person
Okey
It's lived up to what it say it would do
I think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect! I find myself constantly going back and forth between Todoist and Google calendar to schedule my stuff! All in all a great app though
Its better to put more options for notifications Actually the best notifiaction options is for samsung reminder
Make it easier to learn how to use it.
I like it but I do wish they could have alarms or reminders or something
Making a list is not something I find easy. But ToDoist is making it happen.
Best app ever! But we cant resort task from widget 😕 plz add this feature tnx alot❤
"Task sections with a ""/” in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me."
Works great!
Pretty cool app the best for to list or management I've ever used.
Better than all the other dozen other similar apps I've tried.
Good list app. Simple to use.
So far good. Need to check for add-ons
It's the best In my opinion. But I feel tasks should not just be overdue. I think introducing an option to indicate that you didn't do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks
It was a gud experience and I found it useful to plan my exam schedule priorities.
Enjoying offloading from my head and the app telling me what I've scheduled from the day. Great for busy minds
not perfect but so far my favorite to do app
Keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project. This app will definitely help you in all the ways it can. Great for increasing productivity.
"This app IS great, and has the potential to be greater! However, my only 2 requests is when you add a ""Parent Project"" to your ""Favorites,"" please include the projects within it as well! And to also make setting alarms to your tasks more simple, and reliable. Thanks!"
I appreciate the reminders!
Found usefull
I'd like to see a list of the tasks I've done in the last 30 days.
Add pomodoro timer
Great but could use more assistance features to help automate your task management
Helps me reminder the important tasks to do.
I am still testing it efficiency.
Awesome to do and project management would revommend also i hope to get the premium soon!
420/420 amazing app that beats my lame ass planner
A really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it.
Reminder is a paid feature and the premium version is too costly.
Free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done.
So far this app has been very helpful. I will be trying out the premium version very soon. Once I do I will update this review.
The handling is very fast and intuitive.
Works great
Enjoying it so far. I just cant seem to sync it with my calendar so I get no notifications for my to-do list and I need to open the app to check I need to do.
Nice app to keep me Focused!
So helpful tool.
It's fantastic! But I took a star off because they nagged me to rate it.
Eu gosto muito do aplicativo. A minha sugestão seria para ter a opção de não excluir as tarefas concluídas porque psicologicamente falando dá uma satisfação chegar ao fim do dia e ver todas as tarefas que foram feitas com um risquinho... 😉
Unfortunatelly you must to pay for reminders! :(
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars."
Ll
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.
Straight forward
Good but a little overwhelming.
Very nice app! Easy to use.
For now am on love the the app is very very efficient
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists
Great app! Keeps up to date
This is a useful tool
Missing back buttons on some screens. Otherwise great.
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review
Always a good thing! Great! Wonderful!
Overall it's a great app I just wish I could link it with my Google calendar or that it worked better with Google assistant
Doesn't link with my calendar or emails
Gd
It's a great organizational tool
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.
Limits lists to 200 items. That was old. It's better now
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app
great for use
Makes me productive because I'm always up to a schedule
Easy to navigate in order to keep track of tasks.
Great app. Are you going to add the ability to attach images to actions?
It's Good.
Fun and simple to use
Just using the free version and use Inbox for just a list of things to do.
Pros: Intuitive design Great way to acheive goals Cons: Not entirely free It works with google calendar but each task only can be in 1 hr intervals
Would've been 5 stars if I am able to move around the arrangements of my tasks.
Best for schedule
It helps me think through all the elements needed to truly cross something off my list.
Great product
Really help me to manage my day 👍😊
Easy to use very stable and works well with GTD methodology
Does its job
helps to concentrate 🤪
Easy to use and packed with features
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist."
Good
It could be much better if I could see my done tasks and not destroying them...
Easy and practical 👍
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} 🤔. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.
Great overall app to get yourself organized
32780 Weather 666IU778 Is a Kitten 27gh with q many different 87878How 1
Great so far after a few days free trial.
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.
This is the best. Why I give this 4 star? Because you need to be in premium to use the alarm thing
Great for getting reminded of your tasks
Good app that reminds me of my daily tasks
The free version is a bit too limeted. However it does worth it
Only wish missed dailys wouldn't count for the current day too. Otherwise brilliant!
Love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now I do not get reminder for anything on time.
It helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently :)
Wish the free version had more features
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.
So far so good..Im seeing if its worth paying for...Ive tried sooo many organizational apps.
Easy to use. No dramas. Very streamline for basic list use.
Very simple and easy to use.
Great for groceries and remembering long-term to-dos
Very nice
It is great
Just getting started on it.
Appreciate this app. It gives me a convenient way to list tasks on the fly!
Nice if you're bad at remembering everything you have to do. Quick and convenient.
Loving it...
Easy to use
Is it possible to implement statistics on completing repetitive tasks?
This is a great tool with a minimalist design. One feature I would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget. That would take this to the next level.
This app is such high quality in its usage and visual design. It's on par with the quality you'd expect from Google.
Awesome app. I am enjoying its simplicity and effectiveness.
Very good!!!
This app is one of the coolest app
Exceptional tool to boost one's productivity. Thanks for this amazing app.
Love it!
Good stuff. Helped me realise what a stupid slacker i am. Brb gonna go jump off a cliff now
Best app for to-dos. The highlight is Natural Language Processing.
Great!
Changed my life
Simple but flexible app for managing todo lists and notifications.
Great app and it is way better than your regular reminder application. Gonna start using it for my daily life routine
Can you please available the mobile reminder service for free? It's very important for me but I am not able to buy it.
Best todo app
Superb.
Amezing
Extremely useful app!
Very useful. Thanks
Really helps me get stuff done and on time...
Just became perfect. They listen to customers' feedback. Impressed how they improved all the shortcomings they had before.
It is great app to plan your day. It is easy to use and fast.
Very good
Absolutely amazing app and seriously have nothing bad to say. I wish that we can get more perks as we use the app and its features more to encourage us to mange our time wisely
Basic and nice. I can advice
Nice app
I love the fact that I can create a list of items to do and check them off as I go right here in this app. The notifications are like my own personal secretary. It has helped me tremendously with productivity.
L it is excellent marvelous amazing
Like
Extremely easy to use with excellent visual cues.
Extremely helpful. This app has helped me form new habits and become way more productive.
Love it! Easy project organization and to do list option. The widget for Andriod is AMAZING!
👌✨
This app is where I have outsources my brain. My entire life runs on this app and it's so smooth compared to many others. I love how seamless the experience feels between devices
It's a great app for the one's who don't want to waste their very single moments in this life. It's helpful in achieving goals and to increase productivity in your daily life. Thank you so much to #Doist. Keep moving forward ♥️
The best of the best Plan youe entire life 💜💜💜
Great app to plan your day!
I am new to it but so far an excellent app
This app is so amazingly done and so helpful. I can't begin to describe how much value this app has to me. This app make a huge difference in my life by allowing me to build habits and be consistent with them!!
Helps me member and get so much done
Brilliant App! Been using it every day for over 3 years and I love it.
Excellent and very helpful
Love the sync
You remind of the todos I had planned to do and didn't do. This keeps me updated. Love it
Helps me cope with my preoccupied life
Love it. Feel less stressed and more organised lately.
Best todo app ever
Extremely helpful at helping me keep track of all the task I need to get throughout the day.
It's very easy to add tasks with its incredible Natural Language Processing.
Superb app! fulfilling more than expected
Just amazing. I just want an option to set the list in order that i prefer even if I set them by !!1 !!2 !!3 or !!4.
Perfect and awesome
it was easy to use and very helpful to put my to-do in a digital form
Love this app!
I love it
Android has very few todo/reminder apps that are even worth downloading. This app is an exception and definitely worth the download.
Excellent App.
Very user friendly. nice UX job.
Awesome app. A request to the devs: I wish there was some way o take notes in this app that is linked with a task. So it will be better for future reminders.
A fantastic app for trying to manage your life and time.. yet still fail. But the app actually makes me remember that I have something to do. But still.. I won't do it.. for.. reasons.
A real help to get up to speed with remembering task of new job.
This app is a big help for me in my Work-Study-Life Management.
Good
The best customer experience I had in 12 years.
Super useful app!
The free version is pretty easy sofar
"Update: As a big user of sub-projects, I was disappointed to see their usefulness go when they no longer appeared in the main project. However, I have recently been pleased to notice the new ""Sections"" feature now allows me to replicate that functionality, and being able to display them a board is a nice touch. I also appreciate how the functionality of the Wear OS app has come along when other developers have been dropping watch support."
UPDATE: Thank you for the fantastic updates on this product! I've moved completely to Todoist now and greatly appreciate the support community. Recommend subscribing to Carl Pullin's YouTube channel to learn all kinds of goodness with using Todoist. Use for GTD. Capture is excellent! Processing and Organizing are easy. Still working on review discipline.
Great
My organisation skills have never been as good before I used this app. Its on all my devices. Makes sure every day of the year is not wasted
On the free version. Very intuitive and has made a difference to my organisation. Thank you!
The best organizational tool on my phonesv
Excellent program and several YouTube videos to better understand the use of the software.
Very functional and satisfying to use! On an Oppo phone.
Imposter
Excellent Task Management 👍👍
Bom
Very Good!
I'm really enjoying this app. It's helping me juggle between planning my cross-country move and daily life
Easy to use and can integrate with other apps
Can't imagine living without it 😅😅
Good
I've used several and this is the best I've used. Clean interface and every feature I want.
It could really help me to be more well organized
I really love this app.it helps me focus on my study
Good
Used this app to get away from physical to do lists I had scattered everywhere. Works great and I appreciate the ability to really organize my lists!
It helps me be more efficient!
Great app helps plan my day and give me foresight into what's coming up
Like the fact that Desktop and App syns automatically
Excellent application
Love the product. Keeps my life on track.
Great experience.
Sync across devices easily and quickly. Easy to create lists and love the layout
This is the best to-do list app. Much better than Google or Microsoft alternatives.
Very good experience with todoist
Perfect software for actio items management
🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘
Great app
To focus on studying with this app is a brilliant idea cause it reminds you to do homework even more strictly than your teachers. A must-have app
Enjoying the process to choose what is essential.
Very effective way to plan and execute the day to day activities.
I looooove this app i really recomend it its easy to use and it reminds you
Very good. It's worth using properly. Take a little time to learn everything about it and you will find that you have more time and less stress.
Its perfect for student's like me who take every day as challenge and tend to forget what's important each day.
Great!
For a disorganized person -me- this is a big help and pretty easy to use
Excellent and very straightforward and easy to use especially now Boards (kanban-style) are here. As I am very spatially-oriented this is ideal for me.
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it."
Very useful. It helps keep track of productivity very well.
Wonderful app! Really helps me to work on what's important!
Perfect
Good app... helps to check each activity on hand.
It's a great app.... love it
I love the feeling of ticking off things I've purposes to do and actually accomplished at the end of the day and todoist aids in that great sense of accomplishment. Super grateful
Maybe I'll get around to using it!
Best productivity tool ever
Excellent app. Very easy to use!
Worth it. Simple Elegant Useful
Love it! Nice way to stay organized
By far the absolute best to-do app! The free version is great and the paid version is even greater!
Awesome experience 👏
This app changed my life. Nice overlay.
Very usefull app for procrastinators
Still learning how to integrate this app to my workflow.
Goods App
Very versatile and easy to use
Been using this app for 3 years.
This is beginning to change my life.
The best option for productivity. Use this tool with GTD system and see the magic.
Intuitive and very helpful 👌
Very user friendly
Best todo list I have used so far. Works on every device I have just perfect ❤️
I've tried to use to-do list type applications before. I see the benefit in them. But they never really stuck with me. The customization and organization options in this app make it great. I use it daily.
The new board view is a nice improvement.
Great
Great reminders
Awsome! Love that google assistant take my voice notes to todoist!
Great so far
Great app to keep on top of life!
Great for basic lists to project management!
I love the app
Amazing tool to organize your day.
Great app.
Great app
I'm enjoying a lot my experience with todoist. My productivity is increasing.
I love it
This app is fantastic! It is so easy to use and has a sleek dashboard that makes it easy to follow up on my own tasks. Free version is great and has all the features I need.
Superb
The perfect to do app.
Awesome
Absolutely love this App! Especially it's support for markdown 😉
Phenomenal
I like the app so far. Good game changer.
cool app
Honestly the best app I could ask for. Managing and completing tasks in a form of projects.
Good
Pointless to have an account if you cannot have a task that lasts two days without paying for premium. Pomodoro is also premium.
"Crashes my phone everytime a notification pops up to ask if I did a task. Shame because I like feature of building a habit but they can't even get this one feature right. This is just a guess but I believe it's because of the second pop-up after you hit ""yes"" to rate your mood. Pretty useless additional feature."
Not advisable and reliable. highly complicated.
Love ticktick but the lag on the latest version of the mobile app is unbearable.
I paid so much......can you remove the subtask...is annoying...lagging..hang...not the best anymore...extremely dissapointed....worse and worse...please..please...do a new update...
I PAID FOR THIS YESTERDAY AND I GOT MY PREMIUM ONLY FOR ONE DAY??? TODAY I'M NOT PREMIUM AGAIN?? I had enough disappointment because my 2nd device didn't get premium after I PAID and now my first device also like this??? I emailed you since yesterday and also write on feedback on app but I got NO REPLY!!!
I am a premium subscriber for 2 months. I billed for October but my premium expired. And app support is not replying to my emails
So much features require to pay to use! Evil money hungry developer.
Garbage
How do you sync? This is next to worthless unless you can sync.
I don't get a completion sound when I finish a Pomodoro
"I love this app but the sync stoped working. If I write list items on my phone (oneplus 6 - android 10) and after I open my desktop (win10) client than my phone sync to my pc. This leads that all my notes dissapire. I am coming from google notes, there the sync is nearly instantly, back and forth. I love to see this core function to be fixed as many others noted earlier. I also ""locked"" the app in the backgound tasks, and reinstalled. No succes for me. I will give 5* if this problem is solved."
Worst app
concept is ok but I dont like ui it make me think a lot maybe the design is very clean
Did not do what it said that it was going to do.
I couldn't use this app... cause payment method isn't available.... it would be great if you add some more payment options like bkash...
Useless without a paid subscription. Not even a weekly view is possible.
"The tasks don't show when I go to a particular date such as the next day. It says ""you have a free day"" even though all my tasks are set to daily( what is the difference between 'Daily' and 'Every Day' anyway?) I would also appreciate if the subtasks completely checked off once completed instead of showing the next date unlike the other tasks in the list. I thought that I'd found the app with all the features I need and was considering to go Premium but this has really frustrated me."
Complicated mess
To view your calendar you have to sign up & then after you sign up it say you have to upgrade & by upgrade they mean buy it for a month subscription or pay for a year. 😅 Can't really use it for it's intended purpose without having to buy it. I downloaded it because I was under the assumption that it's basic functioning was free. The subscription price is cheap but I'm careful which places I put my bank/card info as I don't feel comfortable putting any info about myself out there.
Lost all my Gnotes information with no advanced warning. Years of important information all disappeared now call tick tick with no integration. Very poor and has caused huge problems
For task duration you need premium
Syncing in the background between Android and Mac hasn't worked for multiple months. Have to manually go into the Android app and do a sync. Doing a background sync on Android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice. Stop adding features and fix this already
Terrible support. I purchased the yearly suscription and I got no answer using the Feedback & Suggestion from the app and neither using mail to get a refund. Scam.
چطوری باید باهاش کار کنیم؟
When will Gant view come?
Fewer integration with Google Account
Good app
Asks me to upgrade just to be able to connect to Google task calendar. Uninstall.
Nice
So bad i wish it blocked
It was on my phone when I bought it. I have no interest in a trash app like this.
Can't import without signing up. I don't want to give up privacy!
38/year y'all out your damn minds. Can't even view a full month calendar with the free version. Only day and week. Silly devs.
"Absolutely refuses to not sync data with Google account. If I try to use a Gmail sign in I HAVE to sync everything with Google. The app will ask 500 times in a row regardless of how many times I hit ""deny"". Makes the entire app totally unusable. Changing emails is a massive pain in the ass if you already have a Google account associated with it. This is absolute garbage."
Don't trust this. No uninstall information anywhere. Makes it feel scammy.
Price not shown before creating an account.
The tasks doesnt show up on time and it always overdue and i dont get to finish my important tasks. I have to find another one ... To do list app This app sucks..
2.70 per month for a to do list app? Are you serious? I would mind an add banner at all and would find it fare I know you guys aren't volunteers but guys don't think that I am as desperate enough as to pay such a fee for to do lists.
Expensive
Chinese app👎
Too many errors.
The premium version of the app is good....But the free version is useless.. And some school students don't get proper support paying monthly from their family of my country. Every interesting and useful feature arw in premium...
I bought the full version of gTasks Pro from this company and now it's unavailable. Think twice before buying from them.
I don't like this app because...no protecting from this app..
Reminders doesn't work
I don't like this app
Automatic synchronisation disabled by developers 🤕
Worst
Do not work on time
It's Chinese so fear of data security issues. Uninstalled it
This is the beat app of all !!!!
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.
It just vibrate I never get an alert. It only list the task and vibrate when I open the app. It doesn't alert me...
Problem with login
Annoys user to rate the app. Here's your one star.
I can't sign in to my account
You cannot delete the account from application for some unknown reason
unable to login in all login options.. it says sign in failed check nw but nw is fine..am able to access internet..
The app is really clumsy to use. I took the paid version of this app but still it feels like that the app can't help you with anything. It's better to set a reminder of your own. Money waste.
#boycott chinese products shame on chinese president
It's been a good app but I can't sign in now. I can't even renew my premium membership. I love this app but it's been like this for long. You will always be redirected to the sign in page everytime you sign in
Waste of time
Very bad app
I purchsed this specifically for the pomodoro feature (among other features). It's not included in the app.
The majority of things are blocked off by subscription.
I didn't like it.. premium for month view?? really 😂
Useless after
"The date and time parsing is broken. It doesn't recognize "" set up meeting for xxxxx at 9am tomorrow "" It throws an error saying it's past due and sets up at 9 am today . Can you fix this."
Earlier this app was working fine but now frequently missing to remind task on set time.
Connects unasked with fb
This app doesn't work the way we won't. It doesn't notify after even permitting it.
It won't let me remove my subscription
"Unable to subscribe. I am from India. I think this might be the reason. Whenever I click on pay, it shows ""Unavailable for this purchase"". I have tried using different debit/credits cards. Still same issue. If I open in desktop, I can pay using PayPal. But while converting dollar to rupees, it shows more money than it shows me in android app for subscription price. Also I feel, 1300 Bucks for this is a bit pricy. But seeing American economy, and price in dollars, it may be cheap. But here costly"
Bad and have ads
VERY GOOD APP BUT IN WIDGET THERE IS A NO OPTION IN LIST WISE SELECT TODAY TOMORROW OR ALL PLEASE UPDATE FOR THIS OPTION THEN IT WILL BE FAR BETTER PLEASE UPDATE EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A CALL LIST IN WIDGET IT SHOWS IN CALL WIDGET LIST ALL CALL TODAY TOMORROW OTHER ALL DAY BUT IT SHOULD OPTION TO SELECT TODAY TOMORROW ETC.
I dont like this
It's not a good app I don't recommend it everything you have to pay for .
"I've used this app for years on several models of Galaxy phones. Very unreliable for reminders. It even has a built in notification that pops up saying ""reminders not working? Do this...."" But the instructions make no sense and don't match the menus of my phone. Uninstalling now."
The application looks nice and simple. But the synchronization between mobile and desktop version is awful. A lot of pictures from tasks which were added via desktop version are not accessible on mobile and vise versa
Some of the crucial features are premium only
Worst ever had
I can not change my font size..
RUN FROM THIS HORRIBLE APP. I wasted three days trying to get it to work. Duplicates list when importing. App charged me over $150.00. Worst customer service. This is a terrible app. DOES NOT WORK TOTAL RIP OFF
Just another app with a subscription based service.
Useful function require paid membership. Doesn't solve the purpose
it doesn't work |:
I just want to make a checklist 😩. Couldn't figure out how
The free version is crippled. 3 lists max. Seriously? Just use DTG GTD. To do app with free unlimited nested to-do lists with tags and reminders.
"Help! The widgets are not working. It always shows this message"" failed to display your tasks, please restart app or add a new widget instead"""
Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.
One of the worst app...if someone believes in this app.. for sure they are going to miss that appointment..
"""Sorry you have reached the use limit on subtasks. Upgrade now and add up to 199 subtasks per task"". Are you serious guys? Pro version for more subtasks? Why 199, why not unlimited?"
Free version only allows 9 lists. Lame
Cant even understand how to use it..didnt like at all
You block new entry on my existing list and force me to upgrade to premium if I won't to continue.
No subtasks
I keep adding tasks. Its nit showing on widget. Very complicated to use.
Not Good App All u Need buy and clock facility not given
I have used this app for years but there is now a major issue. If you drag a task to tomorrow or place it under a task with a later date the task date no longer changes date. Is there any way to revert to an earlier revision? Hi I have sent screenshots but the issue is the same.
It keeps showing java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start receiver com.ticktick.task.activity.widget.AppWidgetScrollable: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean java.lang.Boolean.booleanValue()' on a null object reference at android.app.ActivityThread.handleReceiver(ActivityThread.java:3421) at android.app.ActivityThread.access$1300(ActivityThread.java:200) at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1684) at android.os.Handler.dis
Very expensive premium...
Apps that cost should be required to disclose how much these cost up front so people can decide if they even want to download it. We shouldn't have to hunt for the cost.
Can't assign to multiple people. Verry bad !!!
I have been a big fan of Todoist for years. I tried this last week and the themes are awful .
Very annoyed by the new time setting. It's like going back to Android 2.1
The reminders do not work.
Widget has stopped working and the developer is unresponsive.
SERIOUSLY??? Just realised you made Duration a Premium Feature. Why? Did people just start using it more all of a sudden???
New update has performance bug very slow in scrolling down and typing Update: after last update now i cannot type or write anything in task description after markdown features 👎
Update: noticed this app sending data to Facebook when I set up my firewall. No bueno.
Worst app I qm trying to create acount with gmail but it say no internet connection Even my internet work fine every thing working nicely even you tube without lagging
Doesn't allow you to unsubscribe from premium and the developers don't even respond whether on email or twitter.
Awesome
Markdown causes laggy typing in description and it seems I can't disable it.
Want upgraded version even to set the duration . Pathetic app.
Um you need to pay for the duration of the task? No thanks i will just find a new app
I don't understand why the App has all the languages except the Arabic language?
Wastage of time
No pomo time more than 1hr. No whitelist available. No feature for tracking task progress. Also add the feature to quit bad habits.
Tried my level best reminder ringtone is not working
Not very helpful
Not good looking and hard to manage tasks
Not user friendly. So many useless functions . Complex to use.
I absolutely adored this app until the most recent update. The task nesting feature is far too sensitive and becoming a real nuisance. I emailed the developers about this issue a week ago and sadly received no response. I'll be cancelling my subscription until this issue is rectified.
"Some tasks do not stay saved on the day I completed them, so I can't keep of track them. I have the ""Show Completed"" option on."
It is very great app but the sync feature is terrible. I have to manually sync every time. Sometimes the notification doesn't fire (12 hours later) because I created a task on the computer and it didn't sync in background to my phone. That's useless then.
Widget sering tidak muncul kegiatan hari ini dan harus tutup buka baru muncul
افتضاحه و حال به هم زن ترین برنامه ای است که تا حالا دیدم
Promising but not up to the mark. List order changes randomly. Many bugs. User experience is poor. Microsoft To Do or Todoist has better user interface and experience.
Why can I not select calendar anymore when making smart lists?
"My phone freezes up everytime I complete or snooze tasks whether it be through the popups or just through the app itself. Edit: after the last update, nothing has changed, and in fact, this issue has gotten worse as I slowly build up my number of tasks. Every night, I tend to reset a lot of reminders for the next day, and now my phone almost always freezes up for a good 2 minutes and then hits me with a ""close system UI"" which then turns off my phone for some more time. 2 stars now instead of 3"
Major Bug in the latest versions... when pressing backspace in an empty check item... the cursor moves to the above item BUT IT DELETES ONE CHARACTER AT THE END OF THE TASK TITLE.
Made promo worse there's no count down just has 30:00 and when i exit the app the time (color ring) resets it's self is this a bug
The alarm is delayed :'(( it's not working anymore
Really clean and seems to have a lot of good features but I got this app specifically to make grocery shopping lists to share with my husband. I have sent him the collaboration invite multiple times and the list has not appeared in his app. The collab feature goes not appear to work.
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.
I can't use it because I must to pay and be premium that rude 😒.
loved it until the last update. now the widgets don't show. just a blank white block that says problem.loading widget. please fix.
tick tock plaece
There is a limit to the attachments that can be made.Not a substitute for wunderlist
Slows down my phone big time
Ugly all white ui themes make almost no difference. No option to keep completed tasks in list. Sync is unreliable and does not even notify the user when unsuccessful. Service is down right now per their Twitter but app shows no errors; sync simply doesn't work. Web ui is extremely bloated and runs an unacceptable amount of client side scripts. Still better than the new Google tasks though.
"Annoying! Terrible. I keep going in circles when it tells me to ""sign in"". And when i want to schedule something, the steps r confusing. Never again, until they make it better."
Great task app BUT it will auto reformat your typing and you can't stop it - this is a huge problem.
Eh....not great for an expensive app. One of my important tasks went missing. I asked for help but response hasn't produced the lost task yet...
nur 9 listen erlaubt in kostenlose version
Thought the UI was clunky and unintuitive. I bought their premium based on an MKBHD video -- I will be cancelling today.
All basic features are paid and the free features are very limited...Very disappointing..
Not intuitive
کامل نیست
It wasn't enough good because Lot's of its features was unavailable.
Limit of 9 lists total. Are you kidding?
Devs tried to send me a link in the review comments which I can't even copy let alone open from my phone because their apps is too unintuitive to use without a manual.
All my tasks have been moved half an hour forward. Very annoying.
It was ok before. Now it changes the stuff that I enter. Please fix.
Premium version only
Good
برنامه ی خیلی خوبیه. از همشون بهتره.ولی جا داره ک بهترم بشه
Good but the paid version did not work as I wanted to use it more so I was disappointed
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists
Reminders doesn't work.
Missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app.
Didnt like that to really use it as a planner I had to upgrade
Having issues with syncing with Google calendar. I added a task on TickTick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my Google calendar. I've tried refreshing but nothing showed up. I've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now. I just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync.
Add a feature that let's me tick tasks off from the widget. Either than that I love the app
Can't post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars. Disappointed because this app has promise.
C'mon. To have more than 10 lists I've to pay!? Nope... That's not gonna happen
widget is not working completely. It does not sync with the app. Plz solve this problem
Night mode doesnt show up under theme
Quick Add got fixed. Now the sync is broken.
"I love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task. This app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work. ITS THE REMINDERS. I'm neverrrrr of my tasks. I never get the notifications. I tried everything that was wriiten in the ""reminders not working?"" But it still has not been fixed. Could u please look into it asap"
Reminder is not working in Realme phone. I did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working.
not backup in device offline ??
Please fix the widget. It keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time
Now when I get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification. There's no way to change this. Edit: reminder pop-ups is already switch OFF.
The free version is garbage compared to any.do. every other click pops up premium warning and it's annoying as hell
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.
"Keep getting a pop up ""Re-authorisation failed"" even though my Google account is already authorised on my account"
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.
"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens."
I would've switched to TickTick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour. 😔
A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019
When i share my task on whatsapp Even though i selected share title and content It only shares title Version : 5.2.2 & If i share my task in the form of image the task with long name The end of the name gets replaced with ... Instead of showing the remaining heading on new line
Loved this app until it stopped syncing... My android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks
I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...
All the main options are charged. Then why list the app for free. Might as well list it as charged app
TUTORIAL ?
Great app but isnt optimized for google Pixel 3xl. i cant re-size the widget to match the size of the screen.
Nada es gratis
No android wear app
I purchased the app. All I need now is to add color to the calendar entries. mmh I'll think of some stuff later.
Don't get any notification at all
fix the lag on moving events on the day display and I'll subscribe again. ux is clunky get a second opinion
The app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay $3 a month just to see a calendar.
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.
i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i can't add another subscription to the msny i already have
"i love this app but it reads my texts. i left one in draft and it suggested it as a Todo item. i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is ""eyes"" to itself. not about it."
The notification on my Tickwatch C2 has no vibration 📳 please fix
Serviceable but not awesome by any means. I've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that I feel like I can't bail even though I don't love it. It's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like I want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app. Nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app.
TickTick please give us students a discount like Todoist!! You lost a user!
"The app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning. It is also not possible to start using the app without the ""free trial period"" as far as I have seen. After the forced free trial period I now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and. app simultaneously is indeed a premium function. This seems awful lot like the way Evernote took, I want to buy my apps because I appreciate the work, not because I'm forced into."
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.
it's just a simple to do list ... why did you locked some tools ..
I'm facing a problem that is reminders are not working properly (device Lenovo k3 note Android 6.0
Came back to this after not using it for a while Tonnes of updates has made it rubbish
mota moti...
Requires access to contacts to work
Do I have to add tasks daily? or can I copy whole list for daily?
premium is very expensive
The features are good but unfair to pay on yearly basis
Task management is terrible. it will kill the apps running to draw over the screen. frequently my camera shuts off because tick tick notification.
anything with a dash creates an alert which is troublesome to remove. eg. practice weeks 1-3 turns into a due date of January 3rd
Very confusing
"App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined. ""We collect your data; here's a vague description of what. We keep it as long as we've decided we need to; and we won't tell you how long that is. We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal. Don't like this? Delete the app"" .. basically the Privacy Policy. Not exactly trust encouraging. Fix this in a privacy friendly way and I'll change my review"
It's worst app
The features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access. Will not buy something with so little real use testing.
User Interface not friendly
Not good. No option to edit tasks (or correct spellings) once entered. Setting time and date not intuitive. Too many steps to make a single entry. Many other drawbacks. Not recommended.
"Another crappy todo list app I have to delete. I dont understand, all I want is a simple to do list!!! I keep trying to add an item, and it automatically goes into my ""inbox""- whatever that means. I went to the ""help center"" to find a solution, but a long list of topics that isnt searchable is completely useless!!!"
Add option remind at specific location instead of time only. If this is already there can you please educate me how to use that?
Simplicity but not too simple like Google Tasks. Even the free version is alright if it would actually work as promised. The attachment function is EXTREMELY flaky and unreliable. I lost important pictures as I thought they have been secured into the cloud but they haven't or just half of the picture. No error message was given when uploading via Android. Without the attachment feature TickTick is nothing special compared to similar apps so I deinstalled it.
It's good if you're willing to spend so much money. How Annoying.
"When i remove all app in recent. I didnt get any notification about my 
event but if i will not remove this in my recent app it will notify. I want 
it run or notify me even i close the app and remove from my recent apps"
"This app is hard to understand. Tasks are deleted without warning or they 
are not saved. Several times I thought I created a reminder only to find it 
wasn't there. I've missed appointments because of these issues."
"Needs at least 1 more level of subtasks to work for me and no restrictions 
on number of subtasks."
"Almost perfect. If the app just have Hejri calendar integration like Google 
calendar"
"Since installing it, it's needed updates every day. I just think software 
shouldn't need daily updates."
"Used to be my fav app for task app.. But there are many features missing.. 
Themes are paid.. There is no local back up option.. I lost my tasks 3 
times.. 3 times i had to add them again.. Going to tasks now.. Much better 
app!"
"Its Ok. It has the only decent widget in any todo app, but it lacks 
integrations with much of anything (no Google Assistant, no Wear OS, no 
IFTTT) despite pages of user requests on their site. Severely limits it's 
usefulness beyond a very basic Todo list on your phone. Also, you can't 
bulk delete completed tasks and the developer said they have no plan to 
implement that?! Finally gave up waiting for the app to grow up."
"I LOOOVE this app! It would give 5 stars, if only it would work😦. It's 
been bad for crashing for months, but I put up with it because I use it so 
much. With the last update thigh, it's even worse. I can't put the widget 
on my phone, it crashes everytime I try, it doesn't give me my reminders 
and crashes half the time I try to use it! Please fix and I'll give 5 
stars!!!"
"This application does not pull or push to your Google Tasks you have to use 
tictic third party service product on all your devices in order for it to 
work. I want my money back because when I installed it during the trial it 
seemed to pull my tasks across but now they're saying it doesn't do Google 
Tasks"
"Not a good replacement of wunderlist. Free version of this app wont let you 
add description to your task and you have limited categories. If migrate 
from Wunderlist to tick tick and you have lots of categories, tick tick 
will immediately ask you to subscribe to thier plan."
I find it not user friendly.
"I used to love this app but, like most apps on Android, it's gotten 
progressively worse. Now I try to add something to my list by clicking the 
+ button, then I type something in, then I hit the send button, then it 
looks like it's doing something useful, then nothing happens. I've looked 
and I don't see any setting that I'm screwing up or anything and the 
default functionality of the to do list probably shouldn't require you to 
change something for something to show up anyway. Glad I tried this before 
renewing my premium. I'll go find another app."
I hate when you say that it's such a great app and I download it only to find out that you only get the bare basics for something that is advised as FREE. I could only view one week and the rest of the features were extremely limited as well. Waste of time.
29e a year for premium is pushing it way too far
Big fan of gtasks thought I'd give tick tick a try. App stops working constantly and has to be restarted. Can't find the lists I've made in ticktick and my gtasks have disappeared from phoneand can only be accessed through gmail desktop. Will not be renewing the monthly subscription.
If the upgrade free it's well was best.
A kinda like it. Havent used it for long but I'll comeback to review
17.10.2020. Have nested multi level sub task. But not easy to add it. Have to open a task and got the menu to add one. Adding Sub task is easier in apps like My Life Organized or Dynalist. MLO dont have a web version. Dynalist dont have reminder if i am not wrong.
Tiktik was the best. But the last 2 version is not good at all. The text of Havit prompt is very large although I set the text in small. And recently the remainder time is showing in the notification panel as an alerm icon of the default alerm app's icon . Please fix it.
所提供的功能都很不錯，但UI/UX還需加強，希望能簡化一些設置步驟
It is very useful in your daily life. It helps u to set reminders of everything .
"The Pomo section of this app, though a great item, still malfunctions at times. When its set, sometimes even though the Pomo time set is not complete, it closes by itself and shows ""complete"" and gives option to relax. Also, it vanishes after some minutes from the notification. Even though I've removed all battery saving options on tick tick and also given it permission to autostart and run in background, this Pomo function still keeps malfunctioning. Kindly fix this issue. I use a Redmi."
Great app but for months the auto sync on collaborative lists is broken as of a recent update. They still haven't fixed it. Confirmed on several devices
I love the app. The UI simplicity and features but If it was possible to add upto 3 contributors in the free version it would have been better.
Hi A
It is awsome if you know how to control it
You should add one time payment option along with subscription.
Finding hard to naviagate
Can we have the option to create sub tasks under individual tasks without making a new list. Also i would like to see a notes feature. Finally POMO is only avsilable for 120min. What do i do to see how many hours i spent on a task like studying in a day?
Quite good
Not so good without premium :(
The upgrade if it was free that well be special
جيد جدا
What a pity to finally found wunderlist alternative app. However I can't use this beautiful design app because there is no notification for all the activities in any sharing list except directly mentioned that person name. How to mention everyone name in every comment. Come on dev. You can do such a great job so far. This is just a setting to receive notification. Receive all or just for be mentioned. Wunderlist becomes the best because of user feedback. Don't let the world down 🤣
Is ok however you cannot download older versions for the mac. This quite annoying have to work with web version or buy a new mac. So much for sustainability.
App is good but habit notification doesn't make any sound
The free version does just about enough for my requirements but no more; limited sharing and reminders are less than generous but it works well enough.
Lots to like but Inbox doesn't work as expected: adding dates to tasks does NOT remove them from Inbox so all your tasks stay in Inbox and it's impossible to organize. Please fix! This conflicts with your support site guide
i don't know why the stick notifications not working i have been checked my all settings but i could not find what's the problem..
Sync could use real work. Needs a manual option for when working with multiple devices. Other cloud services can be seen to work immediately on a second device. There's zero settings for synchronization.
Tick tick should also inform us about the clashes when two things are scheduled at the same time
Not as smooth as I hoped
"Some good features but overall mediocre compared to my old Wunderlist. If someone shares a list with me I cannot easily join the list. The list is not auto synced with my profile. Instead I'm sent an email with a ""join list"" button. But even when I click the button I am taken to the generic sales page to download the app."
It is great app for civil engineers like me as it helps me to planout my to-dos everyday. But the thing is on my realme x2 pro the alarms are hit n miss even after following instructions for keeping it active. Pls fix it 🙏
Best App. pls allow to add upto 10 Habits in free version 😅
I love the app but I am unable to login on my new device. My internet is working fine 😑
"Q oo z a ""446eo""namaste"
Nice app
A Call Reminder feature is absolutely needed.
It's a good app for reminders
Sometimes don't show reminders.
Ok
No doubt this app is amazing. And this app deserve 5 star but I am frustrated because this app doesn't keep log more than 90 days. I wish it could kept forever.
"Just as I was about to rate this 5 stars, it only let me have 16 ""subtasks"" It's stupid. Let us have more ""subtasks"" and I'll give you guys 5 stars."
Good for a long time but recently it became unusable...it would always freeze up.
"I love this program could be 5 stars BUT... a task adds Tick Tick to the shared text in the paid version. This not good and means you have to remove it every time! WORSE IS THE Developer response I got below, clearly indicates they do not understand usability issues reported from good users. "" You can remove the TickTick information manually."" REALLY!!! Not a good suggestion for a productivity product."
The app is not compatible to read my notifications on my wrist band.All other apps notifications do work.All settings are set on my phone to make sure i receive the notifications but in vain.Please make an update for this.(Any update on this issue please)
Lately from past two days I am facing difficulty using widget. Getting an error 'task list not found' whenever I strike off a task. Please look into it ASAP.
No transparent theme
Only the premium version is good
"PLEASE FIX THE SCHEDULING THAT CHANGES TO Jan 1st 1970 when selecting any day, I can only schedule using the Today, Tomorrow and Next Monday buttons, not the calendar, this was present for over 2 months by now. Also, smart text detection doesn't work at all for "" on tommorow at 6:00PM "" for example. Please fix these 2 issues."
Widget is slow
"I simply love TickTick but am growing weary of the widgets not updating. If I open the app, they update after a minute or so. However, if I don't need to use the app (therefore not opening it), the widgets stop updating after some amount of time. Is there a setting I'm missing, or do I need to ""not optimize"" TickTick's battery use? EDIT: In addition, actions taken via the widget do not update the app/website until i open the app explicitly."
It's ok. A bit messy.
Too much options getting me confused and more complexity
This app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors don't. Clearly have potential to be the best in the market. Cons - Sync issues Time to load up in windows 10 Bugs in habit tracker & tasks.
I cannot login to the app
Only allowed 9 lists for free. Need to purchase for additional lists...such a bummer. Wunderlist was much better but I had to switch over as they closed. Tick Tick is not so straightforward to sync with another user.
Monthly widget needs to be premium:(
"Good app. It will be better if the user could set duration of task . For example in reading or studing or every task which need to be more focused on it . I use ""flip"" App beside Tick tick app for this purpose. Thank you"
"Calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky. Can't see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists. Organize view can't use custom lists to plan my week. The sync with Google is unforgivably poor. If I change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in TickTick. This is so bad I have begun looking for replacement. I would like to see a better support forums for community feedback. Often answers are basically ""suck it up, that's just the way it is""."
Why not find Arabic language
the new update has removed the repeat task option I don't know where to find it
ok but it's not different as my phone's app
The statistics show I missed everything in a day even though I completed 90% of the tasks
Good
Decent todo app for single user. Home screen widget does not receive remote updates
3rd May 2020: It was very long time back.. requested for the feature to enable notifications for the actions done by shared members which still I am waiting for.
You need to make a clear all data or reset everything button. I had to delete my account because it triple synced and I wanted all this mess gone and I couldn't. Please consider it.
This is good app
I was little starting to be comfortable comparing to other app..unless the premium came up.. I don't any personal ac to pay just to get reminded 🤧where multiple remider doesn't work..i literally start loving and hate at the same time..u can't get multiple unless u get premium..:) this ain't my app
Thanks for this apps its fells great
"Jury is still out.....would be more than happy to review.....if i was actually given the time to do so before the ""rate me rate me"" messages."
I have just started using this app and it looks great - except for the drop down menu from the 3 dots which doesn't show the full menu and you cannot scroll down in it either. PLEASE FIX THIS!!
need some options and need to be more organaise
Please make a more sleek widget please...
I can't scroll the widget or other screens. I'll probably subscribe if this gets reliably fixed since Wunderlist is dead now.
Pomdoro is bad
Can add a reminder option withthe specified time
Unnecessarily complex. A simple one dimensional version would be fine
It's good but it's size is large
Jus started using. So far I like it.
Very helpful with lots of features. I would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though. Also it would be delightful if we could add tasks (like the notification) with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up! But still nothing I would pay annually though..
Just upgraded to premium version. App and Google play list subscription at $27.99. I got charged $29.84. ???
"If time tracking was added and the parser/interface of the ""what would you like to do?"" field was fixed (this alone is making me want to switch back to Amazing Marvin), I would rate 5 stars."
Nice one
It could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying.
I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported. However some key things I truly miss. Push notifications when someone texts within the app. Notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list. Copy and paste everything I need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list.
Experiência muito boa mas tem muito a ser feito.

Good as it is simple and effective. It could be more enhanced.
Good app but in free version they should add more features just like reminder with time duration. I like it's feature of description in which we can add sub task and tick then.
Back button doesnt work
Ticktick is one of my favourite productivity app but suddenly the habit tracker doesn't work or respond properly.
You have to subscribe for the pro version. I'd rather just have one flat fee
Love this app. I used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load.
Too many items
I would buy if there was one-time only purchase. I can't pay monthly. And it's still enough to use without premium but I want premium and one time purchase :/
Nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
amazing!
Very helpfull does a very good job. When typing an action or notes its very slow on an lg smartwine phone
Самое лучшее приложений для управления задачами. Но ограничение в 99 задач в списке - это полная глупость
Very good app but please update in widget
It's very useful But I hope becoming free
Very good app
Perfect
Has so many bugs it's keep crashing
It's a good app I do use it alot but there are problems with it like if you put 2 or more reminders in a habit the notification won't work. And my other problem is with the premium. If you have money you can have better features and during these times you would prefer to save up. But the app is great I do recommend it.🌻
I think it's a good app.
Multifunction app that help you remember everything and anything and force you to be more productive
Well performing
good but no have arabic language
Its been amazing to use tick tick
If only it had a dark splash screen. I have set the dark theme in the app to keep it easy on my eyes at night. But that bright splash screen just ruins it. I know that Google's apps do the same thing and it's absolutely stupid.
Best
It will be nice if the week calender view open in free
Great app but why not improve sync function on Wear OS. I have to buy another to-do app only because it has better support on Wear OS. So please improve it and make me only pay for this app.
It's good for handling
Great app.
cool apps
Nice app. You can organize tour day. You will not forget things anymore
Not to be confused with TikTok a clearly inferior alternative.
I wish it would give mote puch and be little More user friendly altogether a great app
Nice app
notes are great idea but without end-to-end encryption they are useless to me.
I use this app all the time with great benefit. 4 stars instead of 5 because of crappy support when I had a technical problem with the app.
Please add 2 way sync to google calendar with minimal delay
Simple yet effective
One suggestion: I hope the widget can adapt to system-wide dark mode.
So so
Functional features are very simple and effective to use. Not combersome. Great job
It's a amazing app but when I add task from Windows its not automatically updating on my Android widget (I have to open app to update)
Very nice app. Ben using it for years.
It has the most qualities i want in an app like this
This is the first time I'm sticking with a to-do list kind of app. So far so good
Great app! Life is so much easier. Only thing missing is a public API and support for automated backups. Please let me own my data!
This application opens slowly when I click it.
Enjoying this app
Great way to prioritize
Could you please make sure that the cases postponed to tomorrow retain their positions
Nice app. Easy to use.
App is great especially pomodoro mode..can u include a click to count the no of time taken to study in a day etc along with that
Love the design of app. Please provide export options. (Reason for not giving 5 ⭐)
Great
Good so far.
Nice app
Best Task app out there. Only thing it's missing is 2FA to keep accounts safe.
تطبيق قائمة مهام ممتازة للأمانة ، وايضا يقدم داخل التطبيق تقويم وايضا هناك اداة لصنع عادات ، ولكن كل الميزات ومن ضمنها قائمة المهام والتقويم وساعة التركيز يمكن الحصول عليها من تطبيقات اخرى لدي . لذا سأفضلها على هذا التطبيق
It helps to do tha things in better way. :) ;)
My life has officially been put together
Nice app as I wanted
Best planner app. There's more to it than any simple work planner app. Highly customisable and easy to use.
Good
請問繁體中文什麼時候才能支援農曆？真的很喜歡這個 app 也訂閱好幾年了，但一直有這個缺點。
Nice app best planner in play store Good app for busy people
the pomo in the ticktick website doesn't register the pomos: I can't seem to see any pomos from when I'm using the website in the pomo stats section in the app.
Alhamdulillah it is a nice app but It's reminding timer is not accurate. Most of the time it doesn’t work on time. Please fix it. Thanks.
Would have loved to give it 5 stars but the alarm does not works properly sometimes. Changed all required settings but it still misses some alarms. Other than that its the best to do list app I have ever seen. And the pomodoro is just awesome.....
نمیشه برای صفحه رنگی انتخاب کرد برای همین یه ستاره کم کردم وگرنه خیلی خوبه
Pomos don't vibrate my phone
This is nice app
It's amazing ok I was really happy with the ability to create list and then a task and furthermore a subtask with a customizable reminder for each However the problem start there when you turn off the pop-up notification and only rely on the regular notification panel it just shows the the subtask name with no additional infos of the main task or the list not even the tag or the customized color is included with it I really sometimes find it difficult to identify the subtask hopefully you fix it
👍
Nice
"Quando digito data ou tag o texto do comando fica na tarefa, por exemplo: ""estudar today #rotina"" | Templates: O atalho pra editar eles podia ser mais visível e ter a opção de apagar tudo de uma vez. Inbox e botão de pesquisa: podia ter a opção de acessar eles na Tap Bar."
Nice experience
Setting periodic tasks is hard to get used to.
Bulk voice Sms broadcaster improvement this feature in your aap plsss
Actually like the new pomodoro statistics update but the bar chart has a flaw. I can't see the exact number of hours but rather an estimate because the exact hours aren't written onto the days like they were before. It'd be great if you could fix that otherwise love it.
It is truly amazing app for productivity. I wish to give 5 star but many features are not available in the free version that's the reason I'm giving 4star.
"I'm a ""to-do"" list kinda person, I rely pretty heavily on them because my memory is 👎 I like that this syncs with my Google calendar. I also like the satisfying little sound when I check a little box to mark a task complete (what can I say? It's the simple things in life 💁‍♀️). I especially like that I can schedule tasks and reminders waaaaay the heck ahead of time. Would've given 5 stars, but honestly, I'd really like a little more text options (fonts, colors, etc)."
So far it does what I need
For habits statistics please add graphics of weeks and months progression
Good
Great app 👍 could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list.
Achchha app hai magar kabhi kabhi dikkat aati hai.. usse fix karna jaruri hai
Some lag in sync but otherwise good
Pretty good good app. Does what I need it to do.
Routine tasks if not finished are shown as an overdue....!! Please give an option to auto mark any specific routine tasks as incomplete rather than overdue....!!
Works great. I enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer.
Bring the Gantt view
That is really useful for me. I can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and ... . If U can add note (for writing notes and ...) And something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now. TNX
It's amazing apart from the fact that it reminds me of you events from yesterday.
It is need to support Arabic language
Pretty good app. Helps get things done. Easy to use. No issues yet.
Pretty good.
This app was really good So Far this is the best app I used to stay on track BUT I hate it when I need to pay for premium. Please make it free?
Terimakasih sudah membantu
Easy n accurate....user friendly app. Voice to text funtion is also very helpful.
Some things should be made easier like typing in the tasks one after the other easily without having to press 'Save and New' everytime.
Helps me accomplish my tasks
✔️This App has all the features and customisation required in a Task Mgmt app. And the developer is proactive. ❌ What freaks me is doubts about data security as the company is based out of Hong Kong.
Pretty good. Some bugs.
Good
so simple and user friendly
Godd
Very good
So far so good
Good app to keep track of the to-do list
It is a fun appp.
A very cool program. We want Arabic.
Ok
Does this app have auto sync with Google account?
This works very well!! Awesome app.
I loved the app so much . It is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas.. I think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable.
Good but some more ease is needed
The widget is quite imlressive
Just what I needed! Would give 5 if it had time tracker.
I definitely recommend it.
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns"
good
Nice app
It's user friendly... love using it..
Like this app. It had everything I expected a ToDo list to do so I have no complaints.
It gives notification on time which mostly apps don't give.
Good
nice
Love this app. Would like to say thanks for creating this app. Three star only because calendar is bit buggy. One is there are no real time syncing with google calendar which force me to use Ticktick's calendar which is not convenient for me.
Good fun ... Motivated
Great app and experience all the features are great.
It's really good app... I have been using it for few days... Really helpful... Just one thing... When I add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks... Can I change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom? That's why given 4 stars...
Good
I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.
It is a nice app and really helps me manage my tasks especially study tasks....it should also include features like sharing schedule with friends .
This app is great. Really nice for organizing stuff. Only thing I miss is a monthly overview with statistics.
Really nice but need some more changes
I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others. :(
Good but is there a one time fee for this thing? I abhor having to pay $2.99/month vs just paying a one time fee..
Very good app for time management
Excellent app.
Tick Tick is good but it should add more ring tones please try
Good
this was a great tick of thing to get i am more organized now insted of just have paper to do lists i got a digital one this great and think every one shound have it tho at times it can get hard to know how to do stuff but later on you get a hang of it.i love it
It is good but could be so much better with full Google Assistant integration...
Pretty good. Does what I need it to do.
Current Review: Please Add Feature Insert picture with Task Last Review: Awesome
Optional
Love how it's user friendly on all my devices
يا خويا يا خويا
Absolutely incredible app. Definitely getting premium. It has every feature you could imagine.
One of the best productivity apps ever in my opinion. And I've seen a lot of them.
best todo app + habit + perfect project mangement tool. all in one
Pomo is good
Very good
best app reminder ever i've tried
Incredible task management app. Absolutely love it. They have all the features I could possibly want. So impressed by its functionality and versitility. I use on both my Windows computer as well as my android phone. I put literally everything I need to do on it so it helps me out greatly. So appreciative of TickTick. Thank you! Hope it's here to stay. I'm enjoying the updates too. Highly recommend.
When you think you are satisfied they surprise you with more .
Useful. Very convenient
Amazing it gets the job done literally
🥰
Good app for monitor day to day activities.
Amazing!
I've been looking for an app like this for ages! Finnaly found! The best todo app in the world. For me much much better than todoist where you have to pay even for reminders (sic!). Here you have almost everything for free. You have to try it!
It helped me a lot
Perfect Tasking Partner
The best
Previous issue has been resolved. Once again my favorite and most used app. Thanks for recent update.
jus loved the app.
Good for both Track Habits and To Do List..
Does everything I want from it. Clean and intuitive design.
Works very well.. easy to use
Best to do list app by a mile.
Simple and best
Very handy app. 2 notifications on task in free version!
One of the best Work mangement app!!
Good
After messing around with todoist and wunderlist I found their free versions lacking. Tick-Tick has enough unlocked to make a long term trial viable. If I am still using it in 3 months time I will upgrade. EDIT;6 weeks on and using paid for version and very useful with chrome app on Computers syncing perfectly. Update - still my main reminders tool.
Awesome experience overall. Using for years.
مفید
Wonderful app I recommend it
Ok
رائع بالنسبة ليا .. في الأول كنت ساعات اسجل وساعات أنسى .. لحد ما اتعودت .. جميل جدا
User interface is very good
Works good
Very nice
Very customizable and full of branching!!
Very good
This is excellent. Does exactly what you need it to do. Recommended if you just want a simple task & reminder app.
Good app
Good
Good App
This app is really great
Best to do habit tool.o have used
I like how the dou
👌👌👌😎
It's simple and fast...
Excellent app ... loving it ... best replacement of wunderlist. (My mistake about Family Library. In App purchases can't be shared in Google Family Library as a standard. Nothing to do with ticktick team. Reverted to 5 star)
help me to increase my productivity
"Multi-tag search is very much needed! e.g. ""#next #next"" in search bar"
This is app is great
Great app... All in ione app... Should try!!!
Good 🙂👍
Need to little colourfull
Best tasks app. Period
Excited about making a future
It's awesome👍
Outstanding app really loved it 💙✨
Simply the best productivity app
Best app for ha bit creation I loved it Super
Amazing got to know about it from mkbhd
I am quite comfortable with it. Quite convenient. Meeting my expectations well.
I've been using for like 2 years... No complaints
Half baked nested tasking feature has hugely impacted the usability of the app. Reminders and repeats are completely messed up. Don't know what is the purpose.
Okay.
Great tool to boost productivity!!
Very intuitive and user friendly
Great for persistent reminders! If you liked Due on the iPhone and were looking for a replacement this is it.
Best app for being productive. 10/10
Very helpful application in analysis of your effort scores 👍🔥 highly recommended 👍🔥
Does great for a to do list planner..
Good app. Highly advise you to test it.
How awesome this app is. Makes it a breeze to track what needs to be done. Also love the new kanban view!
This really helped me organizer my day
Best planner I have ever tried do far
Trust me guys..I have been searching for such an app in the whole playstore!this is the best of all😍No purchasing required!Without purchasing we can choose upto 5 habits that's enough and more...this is really cool😍😍
THE BEST ONE OF THESE TYPE OF APPS! Has all you may need!
Amazing
Seems good so far
Some daily tasks just disappear a minute after I tick them. This bug is affecting me for about a week now and I'm already tired of it.
Really useful app. It helps you to organise your day properly and reminds you important things on time.
That's the app which I was looking for
This is worth your time and totally recommended app
It's best app for control your time It's perfect app👌👌👑👑👌👌
Ut's an amazing app to control your plans
The best habit app I've ever used and I've tried a bunch! The UI is beautiful and the app is very responsive.
A good one to go with especially with your study time table.
Love it so far!! Favorite task manager that I've tried and I've tried a lot.
This should be default calendar app by now. Give us that option.
It's great for catching up with assignments! ^^
Needed this a lot... Using this a lot... Has become a part of my daily life... Edit: Thank you so much once again for this great app.
"Since joining their very affordable monthly subscription, I've found TickTick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine, and it's actually helping me be more productive even though I'm a pretty begrudging procrastinator. First off, the widgets. God, I love the widgets! The first thing I see after unlocking my phone is A) a list of all the stuff I need to be doing on that given day; and B) a cute visual checklist of daily habits that I need to also make time for. This was what I found was missing back when I used the ToDoIst app, was a simple means of having both habits and to-dos living in the same shared ecosystem. I suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features, but what's here is perfectly functional, and easily integrates into your regular 'inbox'/'today' lists. The widgets update dynamically, right along with the full-screen app, and also with the PC and web integrations. This was a ""must-have"" feature, because I've tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget, and seeing them ""refreshed"" into existence several minutes later in the app itself. TickTick makes everything instant, to the point that a TickTick notification 'pings' on my phone at the precise moment it also 'pings' on my laptop. I really can't understate how useful the widget and cross-platform integration is, because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what I'm meant to be doing at any random moment, it's so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important tasks/habits slap me in the face, demanding my attention. This also ties in nicely with the way notifications/alerts work. I've got reminders set on all my habits, and when the reminders go off, they actually ""take over"" the entire screen, at which point I can tick them off, or dig into the more extensive options on the back-end. There's a few areas I can see for quality-of-life improvements, though I'm optimistic that their subscription model means we haven't seen the ""final"" iteration of this app for some time yet. A few things that jump out at me over a couple months' usage: -- To mark a habit as ""incomplete"", you can't just double-tap the checkbox for an 'X' mark, you have to open the app, pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard, go into its settings, and the option is buried all the way in the app's back-end menus. It's a minor gripe, but when compounded over weeks or months of use, it's easy to just not bother marking your ""failures"" at all. It makes me wonder if there's other useful features I've missed just because they're not readily accessible on the front end UI + widgets. -- It would be nice if habits displayed in the widget + front-end UI had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on ""streak"" for. You can track those metrics, but again it's hidden in the robust-yet-opaque back-end, accessible via sub-menus and abstract graphs, rather than being loudly displayed front-and-centre. I'd probably be more motivated to ""keep the streak going"" with a given habit if I could see at a split-second glance how today's efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days, or whatever. --Also, you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week, or a certain number of times per week, but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if you're on track or falling behind. By which I mean, when I pull up my habits for Thursdayy, for instance, and I see ""exercise at gym"" in my list of habits for that day, then surely I should get some indication of ""you've been to the gym X times this week so far, and you have Y gym sessions remaining for this week [in order to fulfil your habitual obligations]"". Again, the information is there in the app, but you have to actively seek it out. Maybe the more fastidious time-keepers will see to this without batting an eye, but for forgetful, ADHD-prone types like myself, if it's not right in front of me then it might as well not exist. But all in all, these are minor foibles. Fantastic app. 5/5."
Really a full package app for all types of need I loved it so much.
It's a very good task manager app than compared to Todoist with the free plan.🙂🙂🙂
Perfect specially on laptop
Very user-friendly. The free version is good enough. I like it!
The best to do app I've used so far
Best app for sure for estate agents
Best. To do list. Ever
Wonder Full
"Really good app, both when it comes to managing tasks and tracking habits. It supports language input when creating tasks such as ""every Monday"". It also has a few useful widgets for the home screen. Only bad thing about this app is that you have to pay if you want to get access to all features, but it's not that expensive and the app is really good even without premium so that's why it still gets five stars from me."
"The description didn't tell me that filters were premium when it listed premium features. Edit: Maybe saying something like ""TickTick premium features include the following and more"" would be more clear - thanks for the reply!"
Very Effective Application
Good
Its good to organize schedule
Please add Money management also.
Great to keep you on track
Have used daily for 2 years now I like how it's customizable and I can see events for several years ahead at a glance. That native alarm is loud enough but not blaring and it's great for repetitive events or tasks.😻 There are NO ADS!!
Deserves the 5 star and support is incredible!
Perfect💜
Wonderful app to keep you up to date and to remind you to complete your tasks in time.
Good features and Sample interface
I love this app. It helps a lot.
Good
I can't speak more highly of this app. It just keeps getting better. I came over from Todoist several months ago and have not regretted it for a single day. Keep up the great work!
Great Work 💪🏻
Very clean and straight forward to use.
I love This App. Actually Calender widget is very handy I been Using it From Past 5 months.Give it A try you'll Love it Definitely !!
Love the free version! Considering the paid version - seems pricey for an annual fee.
Awesome app The best to do app that I have used and I have. Used a lot it's better than todoist for its coustimization even in the free version. It's just great!
It's very fruitful to get done my work as productive.
Perfect app in all kind
The best I've ever seen out of dozens of apps. Regularly makes small improvements. Always room for improvement but thoroughly impressed.
Good
Very good. And has all the options that you need. It seems they have thought of everything. I would recommend this app.
Awesome
Best in class
"So far, I think it's good enough, but a little advice from me, it would be better if the ""note"" mode added a folder feature, that is, we can ""add notes to a note"". Hopefully it can be responded to and thank you for reading."

So much better than Google or Microsoft similar apps. A practical app that provides every thing you need even in free mode.
The only app that effectively helps me get things done.
Awesome and easy to use app
like it!
Awesome.
Very usefull app
Nice amazing app .
Very useful for task management.
Awesome! Syncs could be faster though. Habits take too much time to sync and some completed tasks on the laptop sync very late sending a barrage of unnecessary notifications on the phone or vise versa. Amazing response time of support and dev teams
Very nice app...👌👌👌
Very nice and easy.
Thank you next
Easy to use. Has really helped me organise and reach my goals. I wish there was more customisation options for maybe one off payments rather than monthly for premium but even the non-premium version is great.
Best todo app
The best productivity app of all time!!!!!
TickTick is making me more productive. A writen task is done task for me
I am very setisfied with your work. Just add one new feature that has a switch on off tap to pause the remainder of any task any time. For example if i make a task of yoga daily. Then i can turn off the task for some time and then turn it on later.
Works perfectly and suits my needs.
Voice alret only missing
This app doesn't have a background music which makes it not like a game at all. No music doesn't make me interested at all. Put like a doom soundtrack or at least something :(
Recent update has so many bugs. Tasks and habits will be gone upon first opening the app. I have to restart the app every time I want to do something. Save and delete buttons are the same color as the banner or gone entirely. I love this game but I'm about to be done after this update. 🙁
👎
How do I save changes to dailies(I have a ton of subtasks I curate as I hone in my routines) The save confirm button is gone! Also the app feels so different than the last version and it's a shock but that's par for the course with updates.
"It won't let me set a username. Just says ""username already taken"" even if I type in a random string of letters/numbers"
Didn't feel like a game
Can't open app after the new update.
this is maybe what radicalizes people into anchro-primitivists
Couldnt sign up . No passwords accepted
Tutorial suddenly stopped and I couldn't complete it.
Absolute mess of an app
Too damned complicated to even keep up with. A video game hub is more organized and simplified than this.
Crashes
I cant Register on this app. It always says 'server connection lost '.
"What is going on? The app says ""server connection lost"""
It's been months and I still cannot delete this one habit. It will not delete and nothing I've been sent has been helpful to figure out why. About ready to find a different app cause it's driving me nuts.
can somebody tell me why the heck wud this app wanna hv accesss to my gmail account???
I have just downloaded this app and I can't register. Is there a reason for that?
I can't download it to my phone
Y doesn't the reminder work!!! I m trying m trying changed all my settings according to this and it doesn't work at all it doesn't remind me i tried and set a particular time and i was waiting but it didn't i m fed up really this made me more anger than ever🤧🥵😶😶😶😶😑😑😑
the app's interfere is really irritating it's already sets meaningless things for you in infine order
"Have to register and the app doesn't even work. Nothing happens when you press ""let's start""."
Can no longer add tasks to challenges. Data won't save. Rubbish app.
Unable to download it beyond 78% even as other apps download in a second
Waste of time. Unhelpful and unmotivating.
Kept bugging out trying to register/log in
Too many errors
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.
Stopped
"Can't even start it properly. Just says ""Path 'profile.name' is required."""
Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran
Mandatory registration
Cant see my character
App has no images on S10+ and is completely unusuable
I was looking forward to using this app. But it wont even let me pick out an avatar. Things just go blank on the app and tells me I'm missing information when I clearly am not. What a bummer
App has many bugs. 1. Start screen doesn't display first 3 slides. User creating is totally not functional. I'm using both Android 9 and Android 10 same bugs.
"The first 2 slides are black and I can't see character in the character creation. Some message saying ""path 'profile' required habitica...i hope this gets fix soon. Until then I I'll wait."
Wont let me change my appearance so I'm stuck as a black female. The user interface is very poorly designed
Completely unusable on Android right now. Everything is blank or not loading. Downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something I'd be really interested in.
The app is broken right now. Downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank. Character creation is all blank. Unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying. This has been catalogued by others. When its fixed I'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iPhone users. (I have a Samsung S9)
"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices. It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken. I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back."
Installed it and it glitched and didn't display many of the images on the 'create your avatar' page. Immediately Uninstalled.
Quite disappointed with this app. Is used to be fine for past years. Currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times. This app need improvement on the server and at times server down :(.
Doesnt work the main screen is stuck i can move to the next page.
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.
Path profile name is required glitch when trying to make avatar on Galaxy s10
"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality."
App didn't work at all. Was buggy from the start of my sign up where I used my Google account to login.
Want to like it. So far half of the set up items aren't even showing up for my samsung s8. All the purple screens are blank. Was excited to try but it doesn't work.
The website works but the app is blank.
This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.
It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.
I have been trying to download the app but its just not happening. Please look into it.
Please make this app offline as well
Will not open disappointed as i was looking forward to using this service
It keeps lagging and dificult to select the traits i want for my character... ugh ! Not worth it UNINSTALL !
Can't set the username field
App is no longer functional. Cant even Start app without it malfunctioning. Cant change username or character. It was fine before the update!
Downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits. Gave up after 10 mins.
You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.
Major issues need all email so I can send you pics pixel 2xl
Apps been broken from the moment I download need fixing
Nothing loads up. Probably a bad glitch
Micro transaction. I wish I could give 0 stars.
I am unable to download this app. It downloads uptil 82% and then stops. I have a android device
Awful graphics. Idea ia great but the graphics need a major update. Can't tell the different between anything in this game. Overall disappointed.
I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR A GAMIFIED PRODUCTIVITY APP. MY REVIEW OF YOURS WHICH IS VERY LACKING: Dark theme is missing! This one appears to be for 5 year olds! Can you make a NON-CHILD app similar to this but for REGULAR PEOPLE not 5 year old RPG gamers? I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.
Good app but i can't do anything since To days ago ! Help me please your app je very usefull for me
Wouldn't even let me customize.
The customization screen at the beginning of set-up doesn't work. Tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it.
Won't let me customize my avatar except for glasses.
Uninstalled. Still cannot remove background to blank. Edit: Yep still the same. Also please put the free backgrounds at the top. This is from only within the app by the way.
Ganky. Couldn't get it to work right.
"Doesn't work. Nothing happens when signing in with Google and when creating a new account, it just shows ""server timeout""."
Terrible moderator community. Anti religious.  Reply: I've already had numerous interactions with Habatica mods and I've no desire to reply further. When I questioned why the website had an anti-Christian stance I was banned. Nothing more needs to be said.
"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password."
Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...
got banned for talking about not politically correct stuff in a respectful manner. didnt even had a chance to discuss or clear my name. would not recommend bc of it being heavily monitored and censored. it does not facilitate what it was aiming for a community for learning and growth. after pouring 2 months and money into it was terribly disappointed after my ban. yes perma ban. no warnings no nothing. disgusting. outsourcing will power is a bad idea anyways.
confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.
I got completely banned from this app today And I have screenshot from reddits about what happened to the chat in june 11 2019
I cant even registered.
Can't login on the app but can on the site. So currently useless to me.
far from what I expected after seeing the pictures...
Uninstalled within a minute because it wouldn't let me set a username
This app runs on internet and is not very customizable. Life rpg is the best out there
It's awesome but we don't know if it's GDPR compliant.
uninstalled because it wouldn't work offline.
because of not available in my country !
so many bugs..enum not defined exceptions
I couldnt even get past setting everything up before it glitched. I couldnt move on from types of goals. A pop up showed up that said something about strength and attributes.
No i don't feel like getting weapons to hurt someone
the big problem is that task management should work offline and habitica should have synchronization feature like anki mobile and anki pc.
I love it at first plus the very idea gamifying a task to make it a habit. It was all fun until the 'I cant use it offline' that really threw me off. Please make it available offline as well.
"You have to register to ""play"". You can't even check it out to decide if it's worth it."
couldn't login
No bank and losing your life and all your gold is absolutely ridiculous after spending so much time using this app.
"Stuck on ""username not available"" no matter what I put in..."
can't change class.
I cancelled my subscription back in June of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission. I would like a refund for the months between now and then and (another) confirmation that my subscription is cancelled.
"Literally WILL NOT WORK, every single time i click on this app it says ""Habitica has stopped working"" I cant even open the app!!! Please fix this, i really want to use this app"
Está dando problemas.
Just installed. Keyed in all tasks n to-do list. Server error. Lost everything. Redo. Server error. Lost. Kept repeating. Frustrating = Uninstalled.
I downloaded this app because I thought that the game concept for to-do lists would be really cool. Opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in. Waited another hour and it still wasn't working. Call me impatient but I just couldn't use an app that refused to work.
Constant connection drop outs. Will update review when this is fixed.
Why do you need personal information?? Deleted.
Hate it
its not like Loop Habits where i know i completed my habit this day. where are the statistics? give me the graphics
More like: how to gain dopamine for being organized. Not helpful.
This app is bullocks.I downloaded it and it ran smoothly on my phone and i setup my avatar my habits and my daily task and then it just stopped working and couldn't open the app again!
Graphics are suck
"I really wanted to love this app. It looks amazing & has so much potential. However, the app does not sync to your timezone. My day does not reset at midnight, despite what the app says. When I try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone, it keeps switching back to midnight. So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day. Makes it impossible to effectively use. :("
Have to register
I CANNOT CHANGE the order of dailies which is frustrating since normally I would like to have them in chronological order.
server issues please fix will change review when it's fixed
It doesn't work. Worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it can't connect to the server
Requires being online to use. Which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated. Would use if it didn't require constant network or wifi connection (I live and work in rural areas) . Had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day.
Uninstalled. Couldn't get it to register. Disappointed
Need to work offline
Was expecting it to be offline
Actually there is a difference between the username and the display name. But thanks for explaining that. Cannot change Display name.
It doesn't work!!
Useless
Does not work
Update: problem fixed. Did you people just do another update? Because the app is completely screwed up. It can't recognize that my phone is connected to the internet.
needs online account? you want to see our habits eh? no thank you.
I keep getting a message saying the app can't connect to the server and every time I tap on a different colour of skin or shirt it stays the same.
can't edit or change anything
Is not working in my device. I can't open it :(
I liked doing my tasks until they kicked me out for no reason😢. Why?
Great app but I uninstalled it because I'm an offline user I wish if you can make it offline with all the functions.
I'm trying to change the language but always stay in english...
"Interesting concept, but the reward tiers are way too steep for beginners. You have to be using this app either constantly, or for a long time, in order to gain decent ""rewards."" Uninstalling, it's just taking up space on my phone at this point and I'm not really motivated to use it."
Every 2 days it erases my goal list and my reward list for several hours then my lists reappear later.
Asking to register right away without trying out the app is poor experience.
"It's good and all but I lost ALL my progress when I reset my phone. I logged into it with my email as I did before then it flashed ""HELLO NEW PLAYER"" cmon man, help me bring up my old account back"
It won't load my to-do's which is an important aspect. Fix it please!!!
Yo how to turn off justin?? He pops up nonstop
The app is so good but it's completely destroyed by the fact that it's online for most things as far as i know you need internet and the point is that you can use this even when it's offline i hope they fix it after that it deserves all 5 stars
"Not for couples or friends. Subscription for ""teams"" to share tasks. Doesn't think money from their micro transactions shop is enough."
I tried buying gems but it doesn't look like I got the gems.... But my balance in the Google pay thing has gone down. Last time I throw away money on this app. Update: the gems showed up the following day. Not sure if that's because I emailed them about it or just it took several hours to go through.
The app itself is useful but they charged me three times for one subscription and will not respond to me when I email them.
I keep running into problematic bugs right away
No good as other applications but good for games and one task or goal like da daily routines work
fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.
Make a go back button
"Was ok until i saw the mtx. I guess it truely does ""gamify"" things now."
"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way."
Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.
"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it."
I love the idea but it's not working on my Samsung S10e. Like the main screen is just purple when I first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options. I'll happily try again once bugs are worked out. Keep us posted!
Galaxy S10 on Android 10. FTUE is busted. First two slides don't load. You get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisible/don't display. Please fix or mark the app as incompatible with Android 10.
Not very user friendly and very less interactive
Certain pages don't fit on screen.
"Would you quit directing me to the website!? If I want to join a party/guild it should be done on the app. It won't let me log in on the site AT ALL.. Why you people would choose to have it so if you use ""log in using Google"", it resets and begins a whole new account without asking, now I have two accounts on one email? It won't even give me my password! I tried resetting it several times. How annoying, bad design. After I spent so much time on the app too, all for it not to work"
"Seems to have glitched out on me. When I put in my username and display name, it gave me an error saying ""Path Profile.Name Required."" Then none of the Avatar customization options appeared. I wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed. Reopening the app took me to the Dailies tutorial and now I'm sure I'm missing something. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10."
I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.
Why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server? I can't open the app and refresh it at all.
Good ideas but not well implemented. It gets tedious and boring after a while.
good app but skills glitch out all the time.....fix this for 5 stars
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.
"it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for ""unallocated stat points"" anymore"
Please make it work offline!!
It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.
Downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best. This was one of the worst. Played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out.
I really enjoyed this app but now if I delete a daily reminder I still get the notification for it! Which is highly annoying! Please fix this it distracts me from my work each time I here my notification go off for a deleted reminder
Can't check of checklist items
Super super buggy on my Note 8 . Can't press anything on the character creation menu after registering . Justin ( the tip guy ) ALWAYS comes up after pressing any of the menus . Super super annoying . please fix a.s.a.p
Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?
Change of days in app is a major problem. I wish it would happen smoothly.
lost the ability to sort to dos by tags. very inconvenient. i used that feature a lot.
It's slow. It'll be better if it works offline
it got boring fast
I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it. I have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working. I have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained. I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.
"Interesting concept but I get a ""path type is required"" error all the time so I stopped using it"
requires an account
used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.
"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!"
"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me."
"I couldn't get past the set-up. ""'strength is not valid enum value path 'attitude'"""
two stars bc i have adhd AND i REALLY wanted it to work. it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out. I'll try again later.... maybe this fall?
It's completely a mess. Can't understand what to do and where.
Couldn't get past registration/login. I've never used the app before but when I tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when I went to login it just kept loading forever.
Not really interesting. Doesn't help if you don't have a discipline already in place.
Too hard
The dailies and habits should reset everyday.please let them reset
Can do better very complex to handle for newbies.
Some my tasks and habits dissappear. There aren't any in completed.
would like to change my my class and chat is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate. a simple notification system would make it easy.
this app is closing down everytime I try to do anything but daily tasks. rather frustrating...
Not user-friendly
It's been really helpful for habit building but it's now bugging like crazy and crashing every time I open it so not wonderful.
"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely. I went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere. The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always..."
Heres the thing. I love this app and the idea behind it. But for some reason its so dang glitchy. Pages wont always change when i scroll. Tasks dont refresh. I often have to completely close the app. Help! Very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out.
"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app..."
this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the editting/customizing functions of the other to-do-list apps out there. i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deleted/archived/completed items. be able to choose colors etc ..
the app is awesome. but it made my phone drain 30% battery per day in the background which makes it useless
Very buggy and doesn't always show whole pages or lists.
Sadly the UI isn't adapted for the Pixel 3 XL
Clunky and very slow to load. Not fun at all - just yet another task I had to deal with daily.
The app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies. Going back to using just the website now until this is fixed.
Good concept but lack basic functionality
The app itself is quite good but without offline mode it's useless for me.
Doesn't connect at all. Pls fix it
This app seemed very interesting until I got into the app and at the very start of it it made itself very clear that this app is geared towards women. The avatar customization part all the hair and accessories were for women. App seemed cool but unwelcoming for guys.
"Google login does not work for me. In freshly instead app I can tap login 
with google button, pop-up asks me to pick a google account to use, Ipick 
the only one, and I'm left on an empty login /register screen. Really 
tapping google login button does nothing. I've tried: * Manually enabling 
phone and storage permissions * Manually clearing app data and cache * 
Reinstalling the app Nothing worked."
"Thought it was great... until I opened the app to mark off a task only to 
find that I had died. Lost all my progress, no idea how. What is the point 
of having an app that gives you experience when you accomplish goals if you 
can lose it all without knowing why?"
"After the update, the widget is not working and it is draining the battery 
from my phone and my tablet (Redmi note 4 MTK and Galaxy tab s3). Will 
reinstall when those are fixed"
Too slow and clunky. Especially with signup
Too ugly to be attracted to.
"Nice idea, but nothing was really working for me, party not showing 
members, errors connecting, not worthy the annoyance"
I couldn't get passed avatar creation due to the app crashing.
Doesn't work
"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy."
"A fine app, except for all the bugs. Any cosmetic aspirations you were 
hoping to have as a motivator (character customization, equipment, colors 
and more) all do not display. Not only that but an error message pops up 
every time I perform an action. Really hope they patch the bugs. I dare not 
use anything else than the checklist."
"I really used to love this app but mobile push notifications stopped 
working, there's been a ton of bugs lately, and it's just not motivating 
like it used to be. When I reported the bugs I was told to email someone 
instead and I'm at a point where I just uninstalled. :/ maybe I'll return 
in a year or so"
"Samsung note8 was unable to get past the ""what tasks would you like to work 
on?"" Screen the next screen selection was blocked out no matter was 
selected or un selected. However the back button still worked"
"It's a gamified checklist, which is a good start, But ultimately not enough 
to follow through on the core idea. There's no actual game here, nothing to 
do, and no true incentive to keep you coming back. An upsetting amount of 
content is gated behind purchases and I found my interest waning once I ran 
out of things to look forward to. Also, the fact that it takes until Level 
10 to be allowed to switch classes is insane."
"Honestly, it's kind of dull compared to the web version. You should add 
more colors, because the current interface is kind of bland. I cheat with 
the mobile version but stay focused on the web. Needs some more effort and 
work being done. The greatest thing about this is the parties, and I love 
that you can use accounts, but the android platform seems a bit inferior to 
the web version. Still like it , though. Has some opportunity. EDIT: 
horrible on Android. Trash. Absolutely trash. Great on web, incompetent on 
mobile."
"Unfortunately, I keep getting connection errors. Other apps are connecting 
fine. I like the app, but it's useless in the nonworking state on my phone 
right now."
"I was able to set up my account just fine, but I apparently made the mistake of resetting the tutorial to better understand the UI. I kept getting the same ""welcome! Here's what you can do with the app!"" tutorial. Eventually it started to hang, so I got fed up and uninstalled. The UI looks nice, but that doesn't mean it's usable. I had a hard time figuring out the differences between the different areas to set up things you want to improve on. The terminology isn't understandable (no clue as to what separates Habits from Dailies from Tasks), and unfortunately, because I still couldn't understand what I was supposed to do and where, it's not very usable for me. The bug that left me in tutorial/hanging hell was enough. I had it installed got a grand total of 10 minutes, and I don't have the patience to wait out however long it'll take the developer to fix it.  Phone: Google Pixel. Latest version of Android as of 17 March."
"I really really want to like this app.  I can get as far as setting up and tracking tasks, which is awesome. But as soon as I try to form a party and battle monsters, it runs up against some issue with Google authentication (I think) and I can't go any farther. I even tried to delete my account and start over, but when you get to the step were it says ""type delete in all caps""... there is no keyboard or place to type.   So yeah, great concept, but it has some fatal bugs."
"Please hire some competent Android developers, throwing up ""can't connect to the server"" messages 6 times in a row when I switch networks is just pathetic"
"Fix the thing (idk is that a bug of anything else), I hardly click the ""next"" button (or text). And its look like nothing's loading, makes me wait and think ""is it loading or not?"" then I restart the app but it became worse, my character not loaded, and the button became harder to click 😑"
Aeesome concept but very buggy and laggy. Won't register my taps in some places. It skipped my tutorial because it wouldn't register my taps to continue.
The bugs are annoying and keep it from being a better app Update: still has way too many bugs that never get fixed. Downgrading from 3 to 2 stars
The idea is great but the design is cumbersome and counter intuitive. I bought gems but was unable to set up challenges due to a bug in the app.
Difficult to use
Yeah.. Too many bugs.
This app has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out. The iOS version is a lot better.
I keep tapping and it's just unresponsive. It seems like a fun app but to keep tapping and not getting anywhere is annoying It just stops... Please fix seems like a fun app to try out
Great concept but i just cant do quests
There are too much connection errors and bugs and they are really annoying. Please fix it.
it's absolutely fine but can be a bit laggy/temperamental
"I love the layout, structure and simplicity of this app. But it has one critical failure There is no way to view stats except how many times you have done a thing. ""Make the bed"" 23 times. In what timeframe? A month? A year? What is the percentage of days it has been made/not made? The only thing I feel like I have to show for this is virtual items. If you would add satisfaction with good stats I would rate 5/5! Kindest regards William"
"I love the concept a lot but the actual ""gaming"" aspect of it leaves a lot to be desired. If there was something we could do or level up to or actually fight. Maybe pokemon sort of format for the game. That would really make it better and keep someone interested"
Missing the integration with e.g.calendar u have to fill in too many forms and manage it all by yourself.
Can't remove habits
it would be so much better if you could walk around in the game and build stuff and talk to npc's like add a animal crossing/minecraft aspect to it that would be a whole lot more fun
didnt work out for me
"The idea is wonderful, truly. But problems exist:
1) Bugs: to-do list, and dailies keep being empty. Refreshing doesn't work, only close and reopen app.
2) Monthly subscription seems highly excessive - I don't like paying for a service that remains static. This could, and should IMO, be an offline app. Particularly with the existing obvious bugs, payment is out of the question right now.
3) Tutorial is lacking: I had to figure a few things out by myself as a first time user."
Waiting for offline mode....
Plz plz plz plz make it offline guys!
The experience was very good the only down side is the lack of offline capabilities
First day of the week setting doesn't work. When the calendar pops up it shows Sunday as the first day of the week rather than Monday ( i have selected Monday in the settings) Please fix this.
"Great idea, but.. I liked this concept and could see how it could definitely help, but some bugs to be worked out and in some place over complicated. Main issue for me was the reminders didn't work on android (galaxy s8) which made this unusable. Also struggled to understand the difference between ""habits"" and ""dailies""."
Nice app although the first sentence of the description of the app isn't nice. Life shouldn't be treated like a game.
make it offline... then it will best appp
Terrible UI
Ugly graphics. I wish it measured my walking distance like Pokemon go
It's not like the web site
Can I use it offline?
It is a pretty good concept it's just not for me
I can't delete tasks from the old challenge anymore
Good app was finding it useful but it's not made clear how you join the guilds or when your reg for a challenge has been ac epted no space to write diary so how do you know people actually were if there was a section for diary overall I found the app very confusing
This app seems to make me want to procrastinate more?
This app has a fantastic concept that being an MMO style game based around your success in real life. The game is entirely server based and I have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect. I would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game. So because of the insane amount of server issues I have experienced just using the app for a little but I could not recommend this which is a shame.
"Graphics are too bad please change it as a gamer we need very good graphics.& And it should have sound and sfx etc example - like the game"" pocket morties """
I'm constantly finding little glitches in the game that throw off what I am trying to do when I am trying to earn points. Thank goodness for husband and siblings who have played this enough to know how to fix things when they go buggy but I don't appreciate not being able to go to customer service or send a quick email to help them update the system and fix it.
Just downloaded the app better review later on
Looks promising but I can't create avatar due to this error: path 'profile name' is required.
Is there any ways to see your progress in graphic? Like daily task you've done and see it in graphic stats or something? Because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something? I wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily. The UI and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev
I like the app and it's a pity that I won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which I need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes
Looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone. I can't stand any app that's mostly bright b white. Went with LifeRPG instead.
I really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs. The first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too. After updating the app it was still the same. (Im using a samsung s8 if thats important) Hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app.
It doesn't work offline and when I'm actually online I need also a vpn to use it :-(
The to do list should allow prioritizing tasks by importance and urgency. It would be great if you could add that.
It seems so cool and I wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in. It takes 1second to load and then nothing happens
"Friend was permabanned for calling another friend a ""mad c**t*"" in party chat, but here in Australia that's a compliment... TL;DR over-sensitive language filter, should allow party chat to be unfiltered."
App is amazing but ios version is so much better than android version. It has many other settings while this one lacks them. i hope this gets fixed so i can change my rate to 5 stars.
All my tasks are gone and unable to load anything.
The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.
"Ребят, конечно круто что вы сделали это в виде игры. Только вот, вы бы могли доработать такие вещи: - сбивается сортировка задач после выхода из приложения. Я хочу чтобы у меня постоянно была сортировка по не выполненим ежедневным задачам. - я закрыла прогу на вкладке ""ежедневные задачи"" . Хочу чтобы при повторном открытии она была также на этой вкладке."
Why it is not giving me notifications for dailies?
Fantastic idea!!! I've actively been seeking something just like this for a long time. But the app itself is super glitchy. Most things wont load and everything keeps resetting. It might be my connection or my phone. I'm not sure. Hoping I can figure it out cause I love this!
######please make offline version because most of studious people cannot afford online apps so if you want good ratting please make part 2 offline
I like this app but this is the buggiest app i ever had i been using this for years and still havent fix them
Love this app. Its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating. I've been more motivated since using it. But I'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my OCD insane. I try to move a task in my list... Only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere I didn't tell it to go. I try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all.
I love it. But the app keeps crashing when I try to invite friends to party and I can't buy gems.
Force closes when trying to create challenge
It miss my data after updating.i can't use it easily.
The app is great except for being internet dependant and lacking an undo button or a button lock for unintended log entries I know there is an edit your character section but there is no record of past entries to use as reference
Its a very good game and I like it but to buy most things in the game you have to get gems or a subscription which you both to pay for. Also I don't seem to get anything when I purchase the enchanted Armoire.
miss the dark theme
The app is what you expect.
Having some equipment related bugs
Too complex as a game! The time I spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working!
Good idea but this isn't for me. I am much more for classic habit apps.
I really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesn't work offline so I can't use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features.
I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.
I'd love to see class selection. as an option when you start the game. I was forced to be warrior without an option to change. I even went to setting and nothing there to change it either...
I love this app but the latest update is buggy and does not record when I check off tasks. Please fix!
a great app! has some kinks that need ironing and I'll update when they're done. But I love this app and use it daily - as intended 😊
best
why doesn't adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience (say if i accidentally clicked + or - for a habit)?
idk if its my phone (android) but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app :/
Interesting and promising but not refined or intuitive. Chat function is one of the worst I've ever encountered.
Missing a few good features and isn't always the most stable of apps
Fix the glitch where if you want to change the streak of a daily the keyboard pops up and gos down. super annoying
Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.
fun way to track habits. It would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers
it has great promise but i cant use it offline so its worthless to me.
"Wants me to write a username, but says ""username already taken"", even when I put nonsense in."
i dont get the point of the game
timezone feature broken. the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs.
Im giving it 3 stars. it deserves 5 stars for the app but getting 3 cause after i bought some Gems there were some shady withdrawals which means the privacy protection for my card was breached... and im 99% sure its from Habitica cause this happened right after the purchase. please increase your cyber security for card transactions.
Please add the option to view progress monthly / year / week
Just change the colour of delete/save button in dark theme and I'll recommend this app to everyone I know.
Great looks and concept. Has some important features for accountability that other apps don't. Task scheduling not as good as the competition. Tutorial needs to be more explanatory.
It's fun
I would really like it if there was an option to have rewarding sounds when completing checklist items in Dailies and To Do's. Thanks to the amazing team at Habitica. You rock :)
I love those platform but the recent update is buggy
Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. Most notifications don't work for me. The redesign looks really nice!
It's really good really helpful. Please put a Goal feature
I love that's application but l Will to be in spanish version I love that's application but l Will be like to be in spanish version
I really enjoy the app and it helps in keeping up with the goals. Congrats to the team Habitica for this creation. I'm rating it 4 because there are still bugs exists and I'm not satisfied with the idea of 'only team leader can end a quest in order to for someone to leave the party'. I was invited to a party by a friend and then he stopped using it when we grew apart which made me trapped in the party not able to finish a quest. I had to delete my account and restart for keep going. :(
Wow! Adhd helper for sure
Pretty buggy but good campion app for the desktop version
Great app but has lots of bugs. That's to be expected though for any app and they are doing good work.
Really fun and keeps you working on day to day tasks.
I do like the app. It's fun and has me coming back after I do something. But I would like to get gems without purchasing a subscription. I'm fine if it's slow but I kinda wish there was a way
Would be better if each Habit had a separate reminder time.
"Wish there were different ""skins"" for the app beyond fantasy, e.g. sci-fi, horror, real life, etc."
Please add archiving for stagnant dailies
Cool but really confusing
Great for getting Organizated. Not sure how the social aspects of quests and guilds work/play into dayily actities.
Love it but would love it more if I could look into the future to see what I have scheduled easily
App is pretty good but everytime I add an item to my to-do list or habits etc it goes back to the party tab. So annoying to go back to tasks every time I add something
This app has actually really made a difference in my life. I am so grateful BUT I feel it could be WAY better. Can you add in: A Timer (for workouts) and perhaps Minigames?? (The higher level your character the more powerful stuff like that 😀😀) Thank you devs!
Cute app. Could do with a more user-easy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator
Perfect app but you need to add night mode
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.
Need a combination for habits and dailies
Hi kindly show highest streak for a habbit. Which will act as high score to break the next time and we keep on improving our streaks!!! Sorry i took away a star.
Good but have more levels
it has very very few bugs in the mobile app but i love it!
This app is really cool and can help build many habits and keep track of to do lists. However I would like options to customizer the avatar more? Like I accidentally added glasses and there isn't a option for none. Can you please add it?
This app actually made me want to stick to my habits. The money/exp system is kind of broken and arbitrary. Fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it.
I wish there was more interaction with party quests
It deserves more than 4.2★. I'd rate it 4.5 for productivity.
Neat!
Nice
Amazing app. Really motivating with an online support team. But so long as its online only its hard to depend on it.
Need to register before use
The auto populated list of dailies was never-ending and repetitive. Who needs to floss 30 times a day? I died because i didn't take the time to delete each one individually. Honestly when i scrolled down to try to find the end i couldn't find it and felt i was making no progress in deleting the duplicates.
Such a thoughtful self-help app. Life saving for ADHD. THANK YOU for the wheelchair option in the icon... the diversity was such a nice surprise. I do wish there were different task layouts to choose from for the front page -- I'm just easily confused I guess! Thank you staff.
It's a good app.
It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thanks so much
It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.
Great concept! Has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so I dont loose life and earn exp! Just one thing. I cant do quests. I got the dust bunnies quest but I have no clue what to do with it. Help?
This app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af
This is wonderful but I really need to be able to use it offline as well
Good
Great for ADHD
Could be better if it was completely free.
The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.
Best app for daily Routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings. You should improve that because Some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level.
Pretty good app that helps me stay organized. Could use a few improvements but overall I enjoy it
Habitica is awesome! Only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app.
Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward
This app is good and it's useful. Yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and I like it. I wish it had an offline mode because I can't stay on all the time but I can see why we need to be online at all times.
Very cool app!
The app is good and all. The only problem is that the reminder does not work.
So far I love it
Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.
"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world."
I wish I could control the reminders for my tasks more. Like the volume or what noise it makes. Other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done.
Such a cool app! I'm in love with it! Sad that it doesn't work properly offline though :( also has bugs
Quite good
Amazing app but the extremely buggy ui have made the app irritating to use and sometime unusable without a restart.
"A great app for tracking goals and habits. It is also the most fun since you achieve virtual goals ""XP and Gold"" to level up your character! Will give 5/5 if it had a Dark Theme!"
Quite confusing
Nice but why does it need data tho?
its ok little confusing at first i think some more of the features that are in the add a blah should be a bit more clear. also a report a bug option would be nice my entire phone is on silent cause im at work app still makes sounds.
This app can save your life. Love how you can pin widgets to your home screen on Android phones. Only suggestion is to add a calendar.
Great way to manage your tasks. Only downside is you set the deadlines and can knowingly chance them at any time
Great app!
The concept is absolutely amaizing😊 but the procedures are very complex...😅 Can you plaese make another app with same concept👍 and with simple procedures...😊 [In simple words... Please make a simple app which has concept of gaming type rewards on completing important tasks...🤗]
"Perfect app!.... but its missing an IMPORTANT tab... its already got Habits, Dailies and To-Do's BUT it doesn't have a Bucket List/Life Goals tab, for me, It doesn't feel right to put ""Learn a new recipe"" in the To-do Tab, I also want to put in my goals like ""focus on getting high grades"" or ""get a girlfriend"", I can't put these in other tabs"
Buggy but awesome!
would be perfect if I could organize the to-do's by date!! they're random right now
I'll give it a 5/5 once yall make it functional offline 😛 (like maybe allow us to edit/cross off tasks offline and let it automatically sync once connected to the internet)
Great app. I just wish there was a way to keep track of time on a task/habbit (built-in timer instead of having to open an external timer)
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!"
to do list and reward system works for me when regular lists don't cut it. Chat in the app has a bug that keeps you from seeing what you are typing.
very help..
"Make it easier to understand when you're activating quests. I didn't have anyone in my party by I was still somehow doing it and finished it by myself without realizing it. Make a design change/renaming so that there's something labeled ""start quest"". Still a fun and useful app. Growth is neverending"
I am a big gamer and always found my self more motivated by games. thank you for making my life action list more fun and rewarding.
Wonderful app.
"How can I set it so that a task would show ""the remaining days until its due"" (like on the PC), rather than showing ""the date it's due""? I find the countdown of remaining days to be more useful than the date."
it really helps
widgets have disappeared?
I never enjoyed doing my todo list as much as this before! There are some bugs though...
Amazing App!!! But still you guys need make a lot of changes in UI for eg: I am unable to decide how much coins should i get with one positive And all task should reset at a specified time by user
Fantastic Habit Forming App! The staff is so kind and helpful. My reading skill and general cleanliness are castle improved. I love forming a party with friends and doing all the little quests together.
Great experience. This app has made me more productive and engaged! Love it
Made productivity really fun.
Best gamification app.
awesome!
I REALLY LOVE THIS APP. REALLY MULTIFUNCTION AND REALLY GOOD!!
Nice app tp start a new habit!
Worked extremely well for me with getting organized and gamifying everyday tasks. Has a really helpful community.
Previous issue was fixed by developers. Thanks for getting back in a timely manner. Great application and is a fun way to keep yourself motivated. Being a gamer myself it is a nice change of pace to your traditional tracking app.
"Great app help helps me get stuff done compared to other so-called ""Adult"" "" serious, not childish"" app"
I wish it will be widget in next update Please
I love this app! The new dark mode is great. You guys fix any problems really fast and listen to the people who use Habitica which I appreciate. Cheers!
The best habit and to do list tracking app.
Increible! La mejor app para organizar tu vida!
This app saved my life
This makes me so much more productive!
This app changed my life
"I noticed how obsessive I was about getting an achievement in some video game..Like a new gun, module etc. I would grind for ages... I thought what if I did this kind of work in real life? I would be so far ahead! So I thought to look for a Gamification app. Habiticia fit perfectly. I'm using the same ""obsessed"" attitude and all my thousands of hours of childhood ""training"" I have to achieve in video games games for achieving my daily habits. Thank you, you saved me. Instant 1 year sub."
This is one of the best to do lists that I have used . Even Google's to do lists pales on comparison.I was surprised to find no constant ads or a pro mode which these things usually have. The widgets are almost perfect except for the hobbies make that 1x1 but it's a really good experience overall . I recommend using it . It helps a lot gamifying ur to do list makes you more eager to do them . Thank you for a to do list that is totally free . I definitely recommend this.
Quite fun. Actually started keeping up with good habits already just to hatch some pets
Idk why I still stop doing my habits
Phenomenal productivity application.
One of the few apps i can truly say that is life changing
Awesome stuff! I just wonder if its possible to have a choice for dates to be sorted from day/month/year since thats what im used to. Other than that great job!
Wow new app ui is looking great
Really helped with motivation
This app has been a game changer for productivity in my life. There is soooo much to do and explore.
The best way to help a nerd getting h*s tasks done! I use it everyday.
Like it. It has items and you become a character that takes dmg and lvl up. Even got a pet. Love it
"I'm only a few days in, but I gotta say, this feels like virtual adderall. I'm excited to get things done now. My to-do list doesn't scare me anymore and I no longer deal with crippling anxiety about all the stuff I didn't do every night when I try to sleep. Definitely feels like I've ""hacked"" my reward system. Fingers crossed this isn't just a honeymoon period, because for the first time in ages I'm ENJOYING getting things done. No more stress - just dopamine."
Nice app finally some good frikin friends
Excelente para organização pessoal e ainda se diverte com o jogo
This app has already helped me so much and I got it a week ago!!
Great app that helps me keep organized and motivated. Fun spin on a to-do list!
Simplify your life with the leveling up system and - categorizing & organizations
nice app
Great app! Has kept me on track with my goals!
Awesome! The last time I used this app was about 3 years ago. Now I use it again and found the updates are amazing.
Best habit tracker app ever
This app combines all the features I've been looking for into one simple interface
I love this app as it actually help me to change habits.
Dame great app
Best productivity app ever.
This is a really fun and awesome why to help you sort your life with the bonus of dopmine fun things.
So far this seems super cool! I'm excited to try it more and leave a more informed review!
trying to be productive
Update made it working again... Hats off to the hard working Devs... Eager to try it....!!!👍
I love this so much
Love it! Such a brilliant idea and really well executed. One of the best apps I've ever used.
This app has helped me in doing my tasks on time. It helps me to be more accountable and be more responsible enough. The gamified style kept me going as I see how much my character levels up.
Just like Solo Leveling
Best productivity app I've used!!!
Great tool to develop new habits. I owe habitica a lot.
excellent app
By far the coolest darn app I have ever played in my life!! I love the whole concept of what is trying to be portrayed here. I doubt I'd actually be good at it because I kind of procrastinate on things a lot😂but it sure is fun already so maybe I've got a chance. But thank you developers for creating this. This can really help people towards their future😊🙏in the most bizarre but absolutely amazing and fun way🤗
Keeps me focused
Very nice productivity rpg game
Actually for once in my life am getting stuff done lol
Awesome! I've become way more organized after starting to use this app. Absolutely loved it. Keep up the hard work dev.
It just works.
Really love this. I enjoy the complexity and the fact that you can buy 'rewards' for keeping up with stuff and that there and consequences for not doing your dailies.
Its awesome
"Helps me SO much. Like seriously, commit to this, get into a ""party"" (kind of an online group for this rpg), and it may help you like it's helped me! I am really lazy so the progress I'm making is miraculous. It really kind of.. forces you to do what you need to do and it's my favorite mobile game there is. Hats off to the developers and anyone else involved!"
Fun
It just might be one of the best apps ever made. It has helped so much with my productivity and has such wonderful features. I love it!
I will reinstall this app
The app is really smart
Helps me turn my crippling depression into regular depression.
Thanks for free widget
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.
Super fun way to keep up with tasks
It was amazing
Best productivity app
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well."
Very creative. and a good idea too!
Very usefull and fun
La actualicé hoy (22/07/2020) y se detiene cada vez que intento ver o darle de comer a mis mascotas. Por favor soluciónenlo 🙇
I'm here for the Ninja Cerebral
Habitica is a lot of fun to use. It helps me more to be productive by applying RPG concept into my everyday tasks. The quests and collectibles are also fun to do - it is so rewarding.
This is an awesome app idea for really anyone to use. Just a great app
Awesome app. Helps me keep track of my daily tasks and routine. I like the fun reward and punishment system in the form of an rpg game. Keep up the good work!
Great way to keep track of things to do on the computer and phone
Super great!!
I seriously like it
Thank you this made a difference
"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓"
Really helps me to keep things organized and is a great way to keep myself on track!
Its great but I need to make a habit to use the app.
Just love it
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones
Life changing app. If you have any affinity to video games and want to better your life you're in the right place. This app saved me.
Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.
Awesome. It really helps me to level up my life.
A good app. Love the concept. Helped me
This is the first time I found an app which can read my mind. This app really knows the scientific importance of reward. I really advice anyone to install this app and give it a try especially if you are a student.
It is awesome super helped me But I have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them
I've never enjoyed accountability before this... Our whole family partied up and is having a blast PLAYING to do chores. Wonderful concept!
I'm really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow. Downside is the glasses and headband can't come off the avatar. So my character is stuck with them for awhile.
Super helpful for habits and breaking bad ones
"What an absolute boon. My boyfriend has ADHD and a love for video games--this app helps him remember and complete tasks much more easily than unengaging notes-app checklists. It really does wonders for motivation. Habitica is helping me survive grad school AND manage the mental load of day to day activities. I'm really excited for the new ""groups"" feature to be rolled out as well. Thank you so much Habitica!"
Loving the app so far! Just a minor note: I can't seem to unequip my avatar's glasses or headband...
Awesome
This is great! After having played it for three days I was begging my mom for chores to do!
10 out 10 recommend for anyone who wants to stay organized and goal oriented without knowing you're doing it! This app is For beginners looking for a concept to start planing or motivating & go getters who want a fun and resourceful way to sort your goals and stay motivated.
Has really helped me get more done and stay on task!
The best out there.
I love Habitica. It works to make the things I have to do at least somewhat rewarding and I can set fun goals for boring tasks.
Fantastic app.... I have tried many other productivity app and used to find it difficult to follow them every day. After I switched to this app.. it became all fun and I am getting motivated to complete the tasks as I earn rewards Suggestion to developer: I use browser version more than mobile app. please add reminder feature to browser version as well. Also please add auto date parser while adding the task. It will save a lot of time in entering the task. You ca take reference from ticktick app
The only app that really helped getting through my really busy schedule
Helpful and fun
Really helped me stay on top of online classes this year!
The best app for people with or without ADHD
Thank you
Very nice app. Let´s you make reminders and actually feel rewarded once you do it.
Love love LOVE the idea behind this!
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.
I am in the unique circumstance of liking to gamify my life and also being horrible at incentivizing doing daily chores. This is literally the perfect app for me.
This app is really pretty annoying. it said I didn't allow any permissions but it gave absolutely no further instruction. So for a $1.99 I figured what do I have to lose. Well I have a lot of time to lose because I spent the money I now have the premium app I set the timer and I got the same message. It says you have not set permissions but it gives no instruction as to how to set permissions and no button that I click works. If it wasn't too much aggravation I'd be asking for a refund.
Heart breaking to see that even app allow list requires premium membership. Please try to help people out and we are ready to support you through ads. I hope to receive a reply from the team.
All the tree just got premium Leading to less free content
I buyed new mobile and tried to login using it but wasn't able to do that.. I also tried by signing out other accounts but then also I couldn't.. Look into it
Not able to restore my account in a new device. Very worst.
It is a TERRIBLE app. It always says Forest has stopped working.i hate it. Dont download.
Can't turn on Deep focus mode
so disappointed with this app! I purchased the pro version then i changed my phone. I cannot log in my account they are asking me to purchase the pro version again. I purchased the pro version again but I'm really really really disappointed I WANT A REFUND THIS SO UNFAIR.
Its not installing in my phone
在app内付费了两次！没有升级到pro版本！restore显示error且没有refunded！I NEED MY MONEY BACK！！！
Erdfyg
"Paid for the pro and im already annoyed. I have several dead trees they want me to pay to get rid of just because I was canceling to fix the ""deep mode"" settings that you cannot turn on after you started, but it doesnt even warn you its not on until you start, so its an automatic failure you can't rid of. Dumbest and most easily avoidable issue"
Nope not a good app I can't log in it I'll find a better app
I paid for preminum version but they took the money twice out of my account and didnt even activate my version. Kindly do the needfull
Após a última atualização ficou péssimo o app.
A sloth is faster than this app. Literally.
This app is so annoying I mean already bought the pro version and I am locked out of my account. This app is a waste of time.
These people can't bring flora app to android as they consider iOS are rich
⚠️ Scam alert ⚠️ this is what happened. I purchased the app few weeks ago. It was great no issues in that. Then uninstalled it and reinstall it again. The problem is it didn't log into my pro version account. I contacted the support they asked me to do stuffs like clearing catches and other stuff. But I realized the problem was in the app. It didn't recognize me as a pro user and I have the PROOF OF MONEY TRANSACTION. I mailed then couple of times but no reply. I NEED MY MONEY.
"I want to love this app, but every time I use it and every time I try to upgrade to premium, I get an ""Error 599"" message. Tried factory resetting my phone, even! Definitely a shame, as I was looking for an app to recommend to my students."
hey why is it so hard to log in to my account. i need to restore my premium first to log in but the restore button isn't working. now im stuck with the free features. please fix your logging in interface
money wasting app
I cannot log in myself to the app even though i just paid for it. The restore button doesnt work. It keep saying error. My 100php is wasted.
I had planted many trees and finally after a long time I was able to earn 500 coins and purchase the sound of night sky and also had around a 100 coins left out with me. Two days later the app automatically went back to the initial form(like the way it was when I first downloaded it)and my hard earned night sky sound was gone and also the remaining coins (approximately 100 coins) were also gone. Ps:I did not change anything in the app.(This app has glitch). UNHAPPY :(
I was a big fan for the longest time but with the newest update? Uninstalled.
It was good at first but then I don't how but they asked me to unlock the various trees and forcibly asked me to give them coin.
great app until the update. I really loved the app and accidently Uninstalled it but then remembered and downloaded... thinking back it was a great choice .
Apps been goood. Helped me a lot Free features have now been changed and are only available on pro mode.
Pathetic update!! This is totally unfair! I am gonna uninstall this app immediately.
Latest version 👎👎👎👎
Why is everything set to premium? I am finding a open source version of this app.
Was a good app but now many species can be accessed only for pro users😥
It used to be great but now coins are useless since every cool looking tree is now behind a paywall.
Worst update ever
kinda sus that they made almost all of the trees and plants premium.. they really wanted people to go pro so that they can unlock new trees and plants.. this new update is honestly so unmotivating
I wasn't able to login to my account actually I'm a pro customer it's a bad experience.
Old version was much better..why were the beautiful plants were moved to pro version?
Not working at all.
I am not able to sign in in this app.....
I didn't like the upgrade. I couldve had various kinds trees!! Now I need to have the pro to get it :<
Just give an option to go back to the old version. So unsatisfied and feel demotivated after the new update.
Mad Game App
You can't unlock most of the trees until you pay for pro version
The app was very good before the update. But now for everything they ask you to buy the pro version. non pro users can't even buy new trees to plant. It's really a shame.
Sooo baad game
it keeps crushing down
Unable to download...its already showing downloaded but it's not downloaded in my phone
Well.....i have started today only....so later i will explain it
"Can't even reset my password because every single time I get ""An error occured"""
"The attracting feature of this app were the variety of trees; this was also an incentive to study more, as that (if you used the app correctly) was the only way to unlock new tree species. You've taken this feature away for most users and kept a few, bland trees, as an obvious tactic to boost purchases, which is annoying. What's even more annoying is the disingenuous replies of ""pirated software"", (09/09/2020 response). Was going to give a 2 or 3 since it's now just an average app, but now a 1"
I HATED the update all the beautiful trees are now in the premium suction it was way fun when I was able to choose what ever tree I want and buy it with the money that I earned from the time that spent focusing now I'm earning money for nothing like what's the point ?
App is not opening in my phone. What may be the problem? I love to try this app. Please help me out .
Awesome app But developer is Chinese Boycott China We want made in India app🇮🇳🇮🇳
Not so good app
It's not working on my tablet Huawei T17..plz solve this soon..i rate it 5 bcz It's helping the environment...now i change it
Without buying pro version u can't enjoy this spp
I would give 5 star before the last update I used to do hard work for those expensive plants....Now i think i will uninstall the app son
It doesn't work for me. It always get out of the app
Support tablet landscape mode please. Uninstalled
The main aim of the app is to maintain focus while we are doing any work and hence it should provide app locks during our work but that app provide these feature to only paid members which is not bad but I think you should provide some main feature to free members also which will satisfy our wish of focusing. you can provide some additional features to paid members but to lock app is just main aspect you should provide it for alll
Error code 600 when I try to insert a friend code
I cant believe the majority of the trees were moved to premium users only. I've been using this app for years and have watched tons of adds. Ill be looking for a new productivity app now that there is a ridiculous pay wall to use the different tree species.
Not at all satisfied about new update. Cannot unlock beautiful trees without pro version searching for similar apps and uninstall as soon as i find it
Why can't we edit the tags rubbish gold diggers...
why did all the trees have to be in the pro version it was not like that before this just makes the app so focused on money this sucks
I cannot recover my vip purchase
Disappointed me when asked for money : (
It's just not fair... I have been using this app for years. I can't buy the pro version because of the country where I live in (Iran). You just took everything away from the non pro users. I used to love this app but I see no respect. Deleted it. Sure looking for some other app
I can't FOCUS if my plant keeps dying. 🙂
Why all the trees in pro version ?? they were free before... now i can't have those plants. change it....... change it now.....
Very boring and irritating app..... Unusually robbering people.... Truely the new update is worst
Loved this app until a lot of the trees were placed behind a paywall. There are similar apps out there without this feature.
B AD
I love this app but after the last update it won't work at all. :(
Not working. Keeps force exit the app.
It doesn't work anymore:(
the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall. this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app. there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them. the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone. edit: there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs don't care. LISTEN TO THE USERS
I already bought this app a year ago. I just got a new phone and it keeps on pushing me to buy premium when I've already bought it. Logging will also push you to buy the premium. I've tried to click Forget Password but it send the email VERY LATE.
It used to be great but ever since it updated it doesn't work and it let's me go onto other apps while in use which defeats the purpose of the app. I was going to upgrade to premium but now that its not working I don't dare risk it if even the basic features don't work then I doubt that the premium ones will.
why did you take away the option to unlock trees with coins? that's dumb. edit: i've read your reply and believe that better services were not provided and operations were not improved
What's the problem!!!!!!! I don't like it coz it always says that the game has stooped u nfortunatelly
Not bad.
"Awesome app, really motivates to ditch the phone but I just purchased premium and the app didn't get updated. It says your payment was cancelled even when the amount is deducted and the bank showed ""payment successful"". Did I just waste my money? Please solve this problem. I have the latest version of the app... it's up to date. I also wrote a mail but there has been no reply till now."
Force closing after recent update on all samsung devices.
Very very bad
Dont know what they did but this app doesnt work on my Android 10 device anymore. Lags for ages then just stops working and shuts down. Not helpful. Now my forest wont grow and will become neglected because I am uninstalling this app next and I doubt I'll ever use it again.
This is worst app....single star dena majboori th...nhi to wo bh n deta....mera premium ke liye 129 rupees pay ho gya aur yha pe premium bh nhi mila....ye log bina login ke payment krate h...to kya proof h ki kisne payment ki.....this is worst app don't pay
I was thinking about buying the pro version when i have the availability of all the trees for the other benefits but at the very end they put all the good trees in pro version kind of forcing me to buy it. That sucks and makes this app good for nothing.
"Hearing other peoples experiences really ruins the app for me. I'm a pro user, I didn't know that all the trees were behind a pay wall now. But to make that change, it's really disappointing. It takes away all the fun, all the hard work people have made to buy trees. And you guys don't care, you just copy and paste the same trashy response. I honestly don't think that putting everything behind a pay wall will ""prevent pirated software"". Won't people want to pirate it more when the fun is gone?"
Fazol app
Premium should be free
When I downloaded it is coming fail to try
Good app
Not bad
Everything is locked in premium. No use for basic version
Its not even opening 😠😠😡😠😡😠😡😠😠 this don't deserve even one star. This is just a wastage of time and data .
i am not able to login kn my account. i have a pro subscription. please help
I am not able to log in There's not option to log in They ask to register again
after September update it's annoying
I'm a premium member...After updating I'm unable to get that pear tree house..pls look into this issue
The app is not working on my phone. It keeps crashing. I've complained multiple times. I've also sent emails detailing all the problems but i haven't gotten a single reply. This started as soon as i bought the premium version of the app.
I liked this app this is verry nice aap
Used to be great until they became too pushy to upgrade to the paid version. Now you need to be on the pro version to buy designer trees as compared to the early days where you could just purchase them even on the free version. Quite disappointed with the development team frankly.
I don't know what's go in on cause from yesterday my forest It doesn't work I'm so sad cause I love this app please fix it
Wow
Horrible update
Very good app for students
"I really liked it until the new ""pro version"" update"
It should be free for all and focused defined
I bought premium and reset my phone and I can't get my pro account anymore. Can y'all fix that or something
It was a good app. I made premium purchase yesterday and unknowingly cleared my data today. Now I can't login and asking me to buy again. Please look into this. Many of my friends facing the same issue. Please make login a feature in the app 🥺🥺😭
Why do you lock everything in new updates? I used to love this app but I'm uninstall it
It is useless. Even after planting the tree app does not stop me.
This app does not notify me when the pomodoro is done. I just end up working for an hour or two. Useless.
This used to be a great app but the quality has gone down over time
I found a replacement for you now and I am very happy 😊. It's the study bunny app and has all the features which your pro version has in free . Uninstalling this app .
It's very bad
It doesn't work on multiple devices
It would be 5 star but 1 star for you dammm new update which is purchasing plants😤😤😤
It doesnt guide me back when i leave the app
I used to enjoy this app but with the most recent update I have no more incentive in using this app because there's basically no more trees that k can buy without paying for the pro version. I'll be looking for another app to use instead of this one.
Got much worse after update.. I LOST ALL My paid trees that i had purchased...... i am looted...... return my species
फर्जी
Not able to understand how to use this productive app
I bought the pro version and now I am not able to login again. Everytime it's asking me to sign-up again and for that you have to buy the pro version again. I don't know is this is the problem with the latest update but I am not getting option to login
their should be alarm type sound when we complete some task
Initially it was a very great experience with this app but nowadays the app suddenly gets closed and the tree gets dead.
This program has gotten worse by updating. This is not acceptable
"No real objective, I dont see the difference from a simple timer. The app is still good, but you can't really look at your forest and say ""wow"" and get motivated. I think this app doesnt keep its promises :) Also I have no sound so I dont know when the timer goes off which does not do the job (it works for others people tho)."
I think that forest is so good
This app has big issues. It allows other apps to be used even though they have been restricted from use during a tree planting. This is despite blocking those apps in the allow list It kept crushing so I uninstalled it and put it back on. All my progress from when I started planting trees was lost and I use a pro version. One should be able to recover those planted trees surely. After all I'm using the pro version .
Used to like this app alot but now I have less motivation in earning coins since I have to get premium to get the trees i want. 😔 Saw the developer's reply in others' alike review but I hope they make an effort to create trees that compensate the update.
This is good app but very stick app I give 2 star because little little I don't understand this app.
The app keeps hanging . I have to uninstall and then reinstall it once every 3-4 days. Please fix the bug.
Totally a black screen coming when ever we are trying to watch an ad to double up coins plz fix this issue
WE NEED AN ALARM TONE AFTER TIMER ⏲ IS DONE. 📣 (PREMIUM USER) I often went OVER time because I don't notice my tree has already grown. (I turn off the bg music cuz it's distracting for me. I prefer piano music.) The excess time I went over could have been used to grow MORE trees. PLS ADD AN ALARM TONE! Thank you.
Bought premium on one device which worked well. Have recently changed device but am unable to login due to a pop-up asking to pay for premium. *Edit The new device is also android. I ended up rebuying premium
Absolutely loved this app when I first got it. After the new update I'm very disappointed to see that most of the content is locked for non Pro users. I had an entire plan for which trees I still wanted to get and the newest species looks awesome! But now I have to PAY to unlock it? The little trees were my number 1 motivation to use this app and get my work done in the first place... now I can't even do that.
The last update is soooo wrong. I'm losing my hours.
I didn't like it.😐😐
I really liked it at first and one of the main reasons that attract me was. The beautiful trees and now free users can only have limited trees and I don't even like one of them so I'm removing this from my favourite app list. Time to find another one. I'm really disappointed...
It take to much time
I was genuinely considering buying the pro version because I really liked this app but the latest update made a bunch of the trees premium only and I had just saved enough coins to buy another and now I can't get one of the ones I wanted and I'm very angry so now I don't want to anymore.
"This app has definitely helped me put my phone down, but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards. After using it for six months, I've run out of trees and plants to purchase, so there's not much more to ""add"" to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins. When I get a new phone I wasn't able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before."
Helps me focus greatly but I cant connect to my other devices. I bought the app with my iPad but I cant log in through my android phone to access any of the data or my trees
"I used to LOVE this app. It felt really rewarding to have focused long enough to buy a cool new plant you've been saving up for.... Now, those trees are locked behind a ""premium"" wall... they're charging you for content they offered for free before. It seems like they're taking advantage of their users and charging money for an app catered towards helping broke college students study. Seems wrong, especially during such hard economic and social times. I'm a long time user offering 2 stars."
Used to be a good app. Now it is limited. Students don't have that much to pay for every app they use.
Nothing interesting unless you get premium 😕 at least let us buy trees by watching some ads
Used to love the app. They make you give phone access to be in leader boards and buy premium for interesting trees. I understand they are worried about pirated software but they are sacrificing their user base in exchange.
"App is very useful but most fun part - planting trees is annoying. There are very few species available. Even though I bought premium I still need to ""focus"" approximately 4000 minutes just to buy 1 2k tree Another feature I would like to have is arranging my forest as I want. Currently trees appear randomly."
I have been using Forest for a few years now and I have switched to an iPhone 11 now but they are asking me to purchase the app to access it. The app is free on android so should I pay for AppleStore?
App is really good at a time. But after the last few updates you made everything premium. We can't even buy new tree species that looks good. That's boreing to plant same kinda trees everyday . Then what can we do with in game money if we can't buy any of them. What are you trying to do. You will loose too many of users by doing these kinda things. So please do something with this stuff please........ Its a request please reply if you agree..
It keeps closing the app.
Love it but had to leave a review bcz of the policy so that I can get that lovely free plant
What is 599 error??? It just stop me using this app!! Hate that!
It seems your pro app for most android user has error: 600 when they use referral codes for friend invitation. I hope you fix it as soon as you can.
feelings disappointed bcs i paid for nothing. you should've let the premium user get at least 5 or more new trees. it was such a large amount of money just for a tree and some little feature.
The most inconvenience I have faced is that the notification sound is not even audible after the tree has completely planted. This make me even more distracted to keep checking on this. Hope forest will take this issue into serious consideration as I was so disappointed by this bug after I have purchased the pro version.
pay money for tree 🌲 :(
Since the update I am not able to open the store
Cant log in after an uninstall. When i press log in i get a pro pop up. But i already have pro. Just let me log in!!!!! Furthermore it just gives me an error when i try to restore purchase. Incredibly disappointed. Loved the app but now i feel robbed. Please fix
Had this app for about 2 years. I had earned almost 5000 points. I got a new phone and everything I had is gone. I have the same number and my email addresses are all synced.. but none of my earnings or unlocks are here.. I feel sort of reluctant to use it now.
Drain phone battery when not using it
Its good
"Until recent update it was a 5 star. If you bring changes make sure your customer services are reponsive too at that time. The friendship redeem option didnt appear in settings after update, so i reinstalled same device,now i cant restore at all, ""error says sign out of other accounts"" i use only one email and i will not factory reset my phone for one app. Dont go blind over money, I really want to help plant trees, now everything looks like money grab."
This app nothing help in focused because i start this app timer after that i can easily open any app but the timer going on continuosly the tree cannot shrink. Please fix this problem after than this app rate 5 stars.
Even after I've enabled deep focus I can use apps that are not in the allowed list. Sometimes the blocking of apps doesn't work.
Good apps
Good job
Looks cool but i had to uninstall the app because it wont go to sd storage.
Cannot login to my pro version after reformatting my phone. :(
Okay
I live in Iran.I can't use the app because of payment problems. 😑😒 I have to uninstall it.
The new update is really disappointing. I was truly enjoying the app and watching my forest grow.
This used to be such a great app... But since the new update we cannot purchase new species of trees... Additional to that the promotional adds have increased. The iOS users aren't paying a single penny extra for anything either pro version or having a group timer even all the species are available. This is not done... You have snatched the mere basic content of the app from Android users.
There is some problem. It no longer gives me warning and redirects me back to forest when I use some other app.
I wish I could set 4 to 5 hours at a time. And I hate those ads popping up whenever I open the app.
Just stay off your phone 😂
I now have a strong dislike for this app. I've had it for a little while now but the fact that I now have to pay for pro for most of the trees is ridiculous. It was fine before. Why do these app developers mess things up like this?
Guys what the hell is pro version.. I collected coins to buy the 2k tree but now I can't 😒m giving u two stars cz I aced in my exam cz of this app.. But the pro version is really disappointing..😢
I request the seekrtech team to please add some tree species to the free version. Please! It is a humble request 😔
Edit: I've had his app for a long time. I was here back when the app whitelist was a free feature. In the latest update the free version is much more limited and free users can't even buy all the trees anymore. It's frustrating to see all the good features of this app being hidden away. I understand new updates like the detailed stats and planting with friends being exclusive to the pro version or making newer trees exclusive but please give the old trees back!
basically if you don't have the pro version you can't use 90% of the app such a good app but you have to pay for each and every new options for studying like pie chart trackers 😒no good
This app is really very good ....but I'm disappointed with the new update.... majority of the tress have been added to the pro version ...I happily updated to see if any new species is added ... I recommended it to many of my friends .... but I'm seriously very disappointed
I realy like this app. Rhe thing is that you only can buy some specific trees and for the others you need the pro version and befor you just can buy more trees.
It say over 25 mil downloads and there are only 10 mil downloads
I hate how I now have to get the Pro version to plant the trees that I like. Maybe give more trees in the free version or give more veriety? The nine free ones don't really give me motivation to finish anything.
Quite disappointed after the recent updates... You are trying to monetize everything... You may end up loosing your worthy and loyal customers by this predatory approach...
"What motivated me to keep using the app was collecting coins to unlock different trees. Now, to unlock must of them, is not enough to collect coins... now you have to have the ""pro"" version! I was earning to get the sunflowers... Why? WHY!? I'll have to found another app. Also, I don't think it's ok to only plant trees in real life only having the pro version :( use ecosia browser instead (not sponsored) and stop monopolizing our planet's health."
I used to love this app but I'm disappointed with the new update that has so limited free tree selection. Please fix that!
Băgați și limba română!
I liked it before the new update :(
Era bom até atualizarem e você ser obrigado a pagar para desbloquear outras plantas :/
He ha
I am really unhappy 😞 with this app now .....I was working hard to buy a new tree and now you have converted all into pro version..... Irrespective of thinking of people who can't afford🙁
The last updated is so bad 😔 i used to use forest about 2y and now i uninstall it im so sad cuz its been like my friend and do help me alot in terms of studying i cant buy the pro version bye bye forest 💔
I really don't like the new update.All the trees are locked and you need to buy the pro version to unlocked it.
He guys
I tried a couple of time but still can't install it. I tried other apps and they are ok
I used to love this app and use it always but why have you made all of the special trees only for pro users? I used to continue planting trees to earn coins for new trees but now my coins are for nothing
My app updated and now almost all the tree options are locked behind a pay wall? This is such a disappointment when I've been saving up my coins! Not a fan. Uninstalled.
The latest upgrade is so mean!! You could've added all the upcoming trees for the pro version gradually. But almost all old trees are now for pro. Seriously? :(
Whatttt!??!?? This app is connected to my other account...??? And I'm not able to change it. I can't pay right now for the pro version because it's connected to a different account. How do I solve thisss????? Help!!!!!!! :-| The app is nice and I need the pro version. !?!?!?
The controls don't work sometimes.
Great concept until I noticed how intrusive this app is in monitoring user activity
Isn't really helpful because one can tap on the home button and continue using phone while the tree is still growing.
The app is getting crashed. Please fix it.
Seema Pant I think this app is useful but in this app we have to pay also but its an nice app
I like the app a lot. But the app keeps crashing within a week of installing. I have to reinstall again to use the app. Please fix this.
The app keeps crashing on me
Keeps on crashing :(
I paid for the premium version. Now it asks for crazy intrusive permissions just to function properly.
Bekar experince...after 1-2hour there is a crash in app
Awesome ...increase ur productivity
Not what I was looking for
Hey actually it's the best app for productivity however every other day it keeps getting crashed and I have to reinstall the app again the next day. Please fix this issue at the earliest.
I would have given 5 stars but this application crashes a lot. Due to this we have to reinstall the app and all our achievements are lost. Kindly look into this.
idk if it only happens to me if you do not apply for the premium membership my app gets crashed and it does not open but other times it is really halpful. :-)
Its really nice app for making us focused but every day it doesnt opens and all my data goes ad every day i have to install uninstall very annoying now fed up plzz fix it as fast as u can getting so much irritated 😠😠😠what d hell. Yar every two days this app is geting crash and doesn't open just tell wwhat to do such a headache am fed up its notgetting right this is 6th time i have been installing becoz it works three days and fourth day doesnt opens updating also done then alsoissuenotsolve
It was really good at first and I loved it. But then the app was not working properly. So I had to uninstall it.
It worked properly once later its asking to upgrade and app is not opening Rest the features and everything is good
One more feature should be added with extra is that there should be A timer becoz sometimes some important works comes in middle of the time set by us .. If we just start a timer then exactly how much we work that can be recorded as we don't want tree dead ... This feat should be added additionally with the existing feature
I got Pro version. App worked fine for 4 days. But now its crashing a lot. Again n again need to reinstall and there is no guarantee that i will Login in 1 try. You need to fix this
App keeps on crashing while starting
I had to uninstall this app as the app crashed a lot of times. I used it only once and then it abruptly stopped working.Could you please solve the issue.
The app keeps crashing.
Worked well for 7 days then it keep shutting. I have pro version too.
When installed the app works fine. But after a few days it does not work at all. The application just does not even open. And I can't even save my forest. It gets me demotivated to start again.
There should have deep vibration mode after completion of 25 min...initial version had that setting...I am unable to notice the completion of task as it vibrate for a moment only..plz rectify it...Otherwise this is an excellent app!!
Super
I just update this app & now app not responding 😥
Edit to reply: You never used to need all these dodgy permissions. What changed? Why do you need to read my notifications now? Update: used to love this app. Now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do: keep you from using your phone. So so disappointing as now I have to let the app read all my notifications (????) or it becomes useless.
Crashing again
can't open this app
I have enough Google Play Credits for Pro Version but while making payment a lower amount is shown. What's the problem?
The app is not opening please fix it It was running smooth before.
Its a good app. Its crashing on a daily basis
Nice
App kept on crashing. I had to delete and download the app three times this week alone. I love the app. It has been very helpful. But this issue has been very annoying
Very nice 👏
This app is still not responsinh in my phone it keeps on closing i have upated it for like a thousand time
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.
start crashing right after 2 days..but the idea is good
It is very good but if i don't use it everyday than all my coins are gone and i have to replant it.
"This is a good app.... but the only problem is I cant use it properly.... because if I have planted a tree and come back to plant another one.... or to use any option in the app, I cant do it. It shows that ""unfortunately forest has stopped "".... there is no problem with my phone.... please repair this problem.... I liked the app.... but this problem is just annoying me...."
The app was amazing but lately it's been crashing a lot and i had to uninstall and reinstall it and yet it keeps in crashing i lost my data and it's frustrating
Everytime when i open this app it gets closed and says forest has unfortunately stopped. And two stars for i think this is the best productive app for studying and focusing
After updating ..the app is crashing ..its not working
Not working great
The App is crashing while unlocking new trees.. I am not able to Unlock New Trees though I have enough coins with me
Worst ap
This app really helps me focus I can study with a go
Nice app
Can we have some more tags? I have a lot of subjects and I need to track how much time I spend for each. It would be nice if we had the option to customise our color tags. Thank you.
A helpful app. Helping me focused in such a cute way
😎☺️😍♥
I used to love it but now almost everything requires pro mode :(
Thats a good app for students
It works good
"I buyed the pro version but after one day the features of the pro version are disabled and all I get it's this message :""An error occurred (599). Please try again later""."
First i rated 5 star but there is a bug . If a remove it from background it does not work anymore. Fix it
After you change it to pro version I have no motivation to study because I dont have tree Iam a student and I can't buy pro version But I love your app very much before pro version Please return it to free version
Good app
Great
Great app but can't restore my premium purchase :(
good
I just downloaded it I don't know what it's experience
please add the widget because this app almost perfect!!!
Its a great app but the fact that you have to pay for a full experience sucks😔
I just updated the app and I can't use it anymore cause it suddenly closes:(My android version is 8.where can I find the previous version to download? I'm sooo sad:(((
Good
Very good app for focused working.. the interface n graphic works are very good. No Alarm or Sound notification for session time completion.. that can be easily incorporated in the app but missed.
Nice
Great app. New update doesn't allow me to restore my pro status for some reason. Keeps saying I need to log out of other Google accounts but I only have my one Google account.
I've only tried it for a few days but so far it's good
Good
Nice
its above average
I'm quite dissapointed about the new update. I'm a Free user and I bought every Tree using my coins but when I updated it all the trees I spend were gone or it's only available in Pro. Since i can't afford the Pro I'm just dissapointed and sad that I can't unlock my trees unless I'm in Pro. I've been using this app and it was the best but now I'm rating it on 3 stars cause I can't unlock or use I spend in a year. Please help me get my trees back I'm sad right now ;-;
I don't like the new actualization that the app have. I can't buy any other tree unless I pay with real money. I don't know what is the point to earn coins if you can't use them.
It's a good app and was very helpful. However when the app updated it signed me put of my account and apparently I can't restore it. Would be helpful if you could fix this
Love the app but I can't sync my devices any more for some reason
I think more trees should be added which are not included in pro version
Really helpful!!
worst app ever........ how can an app demand money for white listing....... i would suggest everyone to use yourhour app.
Good
Was nice but stopped working. Now I can leave the app and do whatever without the tree dying which defeats the purpose. I changed all my settings and even deleted and redownloaded the app.
Nice
Good
Happy
جميل جدا
I love this app but I have one problem the app doesn't allow me to sign up - shows error has occurred. Help me fix the problem please
This app is amazing....
after the upgradation the plant is often become wither automatically; why?
There's no alarm whatsoever to notify me when the time's over. Please help me out.
App size is too big
"Love this app, Pro Version is definitely worth it. However... my referral code would NOT pull up, and I missed an oppurtunity to refer someone. Adding friends and creating a ""Room"" together is way too difficult, and I would also like to see the option to delete tags. Rather difficult to navigate app regarding all these things, but I am hopeful to see what modifications are brought forward."
Nice app but free users have only limited features
اون قسمت با دوستان باز نمیشه
Ramnya gede banget
I love this app and use it all the time. However the selection of trees are now unfortunately limited due to a recent update :( I was lucky enough to get some trees before the update however the way it was before used to motivate me to continue studying
How disappointing that most trees are now exclusive! The version before the update suited most people as I can see. 5 stars going 3
I really like this app it got me off of my phone in class time until my tree had grown I got sooo much work done.
You best
It really helps me. However you need to pay for a lot of things.
It's helpful but I need it my phone and my phone is iOS and my parents won't let me pay
"Me pareció buena idea la app, pero al entrar en la parte superior en ""plant mode"" que te da dos opciones no puedo seleccionar ninguna, ayuda por favor"
Used this on iPhone it was amazing however it doesn't get the data from iOS to android which is a problem.
When the timer ends we don't get any sound saying that the sound ended.
the pear tree challenge is a major turn off.
Cool
Very good 😊
It helps me too stay concentrated Thank u for creating an app like this
Ki
En general la app esta muy bien pero depronto me dejo de funcionar y no importaba cuantas veces la instalara me aparecia lo mismo😐
no bad
This is so good app but after completing the time duretion of studying there is no alarm clock and every things are good actually excellent.
Hey Forest Team! Seen your progress grow over the years loving the new favorites and tags interface! What would make it better is allowing multitag selections! This is one pomodoro app that doesnt have breaks. Pls add a break timer after each sess. Would be nice under your new UI! No trees would be selected or planted of course! Customized break times can also be added to favs! Thanks & lots of love
I have been liking it!
그냥 재밌게 폰 안만질수있음
My phone is not getting locked while using it I am able to use the other apps also
Its really interesting
sometimes it does not shows when break is over.Its only when i open forest it shows break is over.
There's no more option for double coins after the last update. How do i bring it back? Since the trees became so much expensive
All the trees open only after taking premium 😑
Very nice app. Helps me keep focused
Free and great
Hey this app is so very usefull.But the only thing it is lack of a music after the completion of each slots
I dont like the new update
It was a great app. I loved use it while I studied and in return I got to earn coins to get new plants. Now most of the plants are pro only and I hate it.
it really helped me to get out of my addictions and live a days to its fullest. But ads are the main ⚠️ problem
After completion of planting time it doesn't plays sounds notification. And because of this time exceeds in one task more than one and causes mismanagement! Kindly fix it!
It doesn't let you take a break when you finish your study sessions. I love the app and I've been using it for a long time but the last weeks it doesn't work correctly. I'll come back to it when the issue is fixed.
Can't buy the pro version. I love this app tho
I have one question how to use sunshine?
"This app has been helpful to me in focusing. I wish it has a ""break mode"". Nevertheless, I am happy with the app and I look forward to my Forest."
Please add more trees! baobab is amazing! Great incentive for funny trees
Is a great app to focus on doing your homework or the work you need to do:)
I really like it but there are some things that I need to pay for them..
I like this app so far it seems cool🙂
The App is very good But i want to add a ring when the time finished It will be an excellent app when this Future in it
Really cute app and I love it. But I wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer? Take a short break then resume studying. It'll be really nice. edit: still nice but its boring now not gonna lie. And I find it so unfair that we have to pay again? For a more exquisite tree when we already did? My motivation just drops-
I can't pay for the premium version.
App is good working but I can't get notifications when time is over. I hope to that's just a little problem.
They asked me to rate them
Good app
Aplicativo top. Abraços
Is a greap app to stop looking at the phone every 5 sec and getting distracted
I hope this gives more opportunities for people without pro version as mostly students are using and we can't really afford to pay.....Overall I love this apps and helps me so much :))))
This has been really helpful for me to be more productive. I wish that there were one or two more trees available at the start as this would motivate me more to make my forest look different and I'd spend more time earning more coins. Its a slight incentive but it would work for me. I like the fact that I get the redirect message if I happen to tap on an app that I shouldnt be using.
The App is good but uninstalling coz almost many things are premium. That irritates me
Постоянно что-то всплывает и деревьев мало
I like the app I can manage my time more but I'm confused why it's not ringing when the work is done
Nice app to keep focused but the premium it's ok but the app soo good
Overall nice app but it shows a update notification every time I open the app which sucks but apart from that very nice app for measuring productivity.
Best but paid.
I love it but would it be possible to have a pause button in case the user diverts herself from the task by reason of bathroom breaks or any other just cause? I love it though. Thank you!
Nice app 👍 for students
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤗😶😌😉🙃😑😤😶😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
Good app!
Referal system is a little wonky but its great for studying
Awesome app to focus in study
Help you to foucs and also activate the reward system in your brain.
an alarm would be a perfect addition.
Very nice nice but..............
Great app. Fun to use. Would have given it 5 stars if you could take 5 min break on the same plant then continue growing it I like working with the pomodoro method
Интересное приложение
👌👌👌👌
I have premium but thought it would be better if there are more trees available. Since players are able to build their own biome eg. Desert. That would add more fun to the app.
The problem with this is that when my phone screen is off it doesn't give a notification that the tree is planted. Even though do not disturb is off and silent mode is off and the notification are on. Please fix this
Good for studying and doing revision
This is a very nice app but some free features are kind of limited to use until you get the premium features. But i still use it though.
Is it a Chinese or Taiwanese Official app ? Ans me
I love the app but I personally would love it if I could plant trees with the coins I made. Since I have forest I am a lot more concentrated.
Good
Honestly this is super helpful. Little sad half of the tree choices are only available if paid for. But the rest of it works really well.
Very nice app.
"Love the app. The paid version is 100% worth it. The only thing missing is nested tags. I'd like to be able to tag a tree as ""Study > Econ 101"" for example."
It's a very useful app for the people who wants to concentrate for a big amount of time without checking their phones. I'm a student and I use this app every time that I do my assignments for the day because it helps me to stay focused on what I'm doing.
Good app to focus
I wanna get allow list but can't buy pro version in our country
"I love this app and use it religiously while studying, it is a life saver. I use the app along side the desktop chrome extension and I tend to start both timers at the same time, this messes with my stats and the length of time I have ""stayed focus"" is doubled. I wish there was a way you could chose to limit multiple devices at one time. now I don't know how feasible it is, but it would be really helpful and really add to the experience of using the app!!"
So good
I like trees
I think this app is very useful because when I didn't have this app my little brother can't finish his homework on time but when I setted 30 minutes for the forest my little brother already finished five homework in 30 minutes.
Amazing tool for studying
Good
Good
very cute and helpful app:)) I just wish we had more plants haha
It needs a lot of buying which disallows us to use basic features. Majority of users are students so it isn't convenient for them to spend money on it.
Its a great app to focus and check progress...
Its a goof app but it wont let me tern on deep focus mode pleas fix it and ill give a five star
"Good app.. Helps me focus on the things that I need to do first.. Too bad you have to pay for it.. But its unleashing my ""green thumb"" 👍🏼😊💚"
Nice app and very helpful
Help to stop getting distracted by phone
not bad
Wow a nice app east to use and I get a lot of fun
Very interesting to keep people focus and see the amount of progress they are making in there life
most trees are premium now sigh
Good app. Liked it .Helps to remain focused
Great 👌
Please add a stopwatch timer that is my only wish!!!!
Helped me to be productive.
This little app has been great at keeping me focused while at work. Set a time goal and pick the plant you want to add to your forest and then get to work or study :)
It's hard to pay in China mainland
Good positive reward n feedback system based app for focused stay
Great!
เป็นแอปที่ดีเหมาะกับการฝึกให้ตังเองโฟกัสกับการอ่านการเรียนการทำงานได้ดีเลยค่ะ แต่ข้อเสียคือถ้าอยากมีแอคเคาท์ จะต้องเสียเงินเท่านั้นอ่ะ ซึ่งมันแย่มาก เราแค่อยากมีแอคเคาท์ ไว้เก็บต้นไม้ของเราเฉยๆ ถ้าอยากได้ออปชั่นอะไรเพิ่มเราก็คงจะซื้อทีหลังมั้ยอ่ะ ทำไมต้องให้เสียเงินสมัครเป็นพรีเมี่ยมถึงจะมีแอคเคาท์
This app is good thank you
Many stupid annoying bugs!
Love it
Good
Very nice and calming.
Helps me with paying attention to my work
It only give me 10 mins option. That's it
Has really helped me stayed motivated and focused on the task at hand. I can set specific tasks to what I'm doing and timers to go along with them. Then to make it fun I can change the type of thing I'm growing. Really good for youth all the way to professionals
good and very focused app.. to make up everything
I love this app so much it really helps a lot whenever I study. But I hope you could give more features for free?. 🥺👉👈 It's a great app.
It has been fixed! Thanks <3
overall experience with this app is good ..its cute ...works great
I love it 😍
Need alarm
A handy task timer.
Good
You will waste your time anyways its just this app will keep you aware how much your phone using hinders your productivity
This app has helped me a lot
It helps but you have to focus yourself tho
I loved it.
Nice all
This is a very nice app. I loved it. But I am not able to open other spieces of trees. It says upgrade to Pro version...instead you can show some ads instead of paying for it...if this issue is cleared ... I'll change the rating to 5.... It's a request..please look in to it.
Nice 👍 one
It is a very good app
There are still several bug even I get pro
Good
Really enjoy using this app. The only problem for me is that it doesn't tell you when the time ends so I continue doing what I'm doing until I realize it's time to stop.
Good app for focus
Useful app help in increase productivity......
Add public rooms. Where we can catch up with people preparing fr same exam.
Great app.. Makes study more fun
Helped a lot!!
Free version lacks any motivation to actually get off your phone since the tree grows no matter what app you're on
Nyc
Great
This app is so amazing. Before I was not doing study but when I downloaded this app I started studying. It is very helpfull for me. I would request that you should make more apps like the forest app.
Good☺
It is a good app
Great!
Gd app
Very good graphics!
I love this app is so cute and also help me but some i have to pay
It's a good app
Amazing
Nice app.Do check out. All the best.
Very productive
In statistics I cannot see how many hours I have spent on each tag which is really frustrating. It only shows percentage. It will be really helpful if you add that feature in future.
Great ! Error 600 trying to invite friends tho..
I really love this app and my friends and I have created a remote study group using it. One suggestion I have is I wish my friends could join into my group study session at any time after they've been invited and just plant a tree for how long the rest of the session lasts. If I am using deep focus I can't communicate with my group about setting up another study session and at what time. It'd be nice if they could just join for the remaining time.
Love the idea of this app!
Good
Amazing app
Time limit is maximum 180 min ki. B hOni chahye!
Love this app
Good app butif we want to plant tree
Good to use
The app is great.
I love this app. It provides me a method to avoid distraction. But ever since they locked most of the plants with a paywall I don't know about that. Now I can't buy the plants that I want without paying.But I understand they had to do this at some point ☹️☹️.
Loving the app🌻
Deleted old tags show up again when installing app on another device. Also my timer doesn't start automatically in plant together mode and I can quit even when room owner started the timer. It takes 10-20s to sync the countdown timer.
Great productivity app!
Original
If i purchase pro version on my one phone and after a month i changed my mobile so after that can i use my previous pro version in new mobile
Good
هايل بصح خصرتوها كي درتو التسجيل بالدراهم
The limited no of trees in the new update upsets me :(
Liked it... But would have been better if it had more of a game like feel. I mean... If we did not use for like 40 min. May be there could be a bird. If we did not use it for another 40 min. May be she could lay an egg.. In another 40 min.. That egg may hatch... Like that.. It's just an example.
Its a very productive appp .i really love it tqu
This ap is very important app for student... And topper student... Thanks❤
Good for keeping track of your time.
good in maintaining my study focus
Great visual to keep you motivated.
Amazing concept... Students must download this app if they are doing self study
We can easily close the recent apps and can use another applications in the deep focus mode.Please fix this issue.
It motivate us
I'm a premium user and I'll be very glad if you can persuade me to spend more time with the app.
I know this app from my sis. 11/10 would be focused again.

Nice
Its an amazing app to keep us away from distractions
This app is amazing. It definitely helps me focus on my work and get things done. If you get it I suggest buying premium cause it's a small price for a very great app. 10/10 recommend. I use this app everyday.
It is a really good application I really liked it. It helped me to increase productivity
Amzing app

"Just discovered this app thanks to other students, love the ""plant together"" mode!"
Helps me focus on my work but the downside is whenever I close my phone it takes 10 to 15 minutes and shuts down maybe this is because of my phone or something but nonetheless I enjoyed using it.

Me ha ayudado a concentrarme y me motiva el hecho de ganar moneditas
Simply this app is awesome So this app helps me motivate and let the tree grow until your task is done. Keep the good work up team.
i love this app
Notifications and reminders don't work at all. Defeats the purpose.
SATURDAY Please Make Saturday as an option in the days week starts with I'm a premium user and there should be a response to my suggestions by at least replying my email
stupid app with adds
i sent them email for help regarding premium purchase and they never responced...it has been months or more.
Previously I use to get those quotes and will be able to get reminder with sound. But now nothing is working. So disappointed 😞
I'm sure it's a fine app but I can't create an account or login with social.... Unusable
Bad vvvvvv bad
I bought the premium version back in 2016. I wanted to start using this again. Its been many days now and I have not heard anything about getting premium back.
Don't start
My rating reflects how well this app fits my needs... not how well the app works ...
It was a meh app. Good for a while and then the server crash. I cant even login anymore. I already purchased the premium version but cannot use it anymore. So sad to say this but i really regreted buying the premium version. Bye dev.
Causes my phone to consistently crash anytime I try to log in.
It doesn't allow me to log in even though I type correct email and password
Only 5 give at least 10 habits for free
Login with Facebook doesn't work and neither does registering with an email.
Notifications don't work
App crashes upon logging in to facebook.
Unresponsive widget
There is no a daily checklist where i can see what is remaining for today
App is good enough ; but hanging / not working / making bad your phone ; Don't download it ; it will make your phone worst situation 😔😔👎👎👎👎
It said hello super(wo)man which was pretty annoying. Uninstalled.
Can't use the app because it won't let me in! Keeps telling me to login but nothing happens!
Can't even sign in. Error notif says I have no internet connection.
Suddenly stopped giving any notifications. Without these the app just isn't useful at all.
eh pretty good but i dont like it 😞
8/8/20 Update: Signed in 3 devices. Added 7 habits. No sync on any of devices. FAIL. Original post 7/31/19: I bought Premium in 2016. Worked great. Was a 5★ app. Recently had to uninstall/reinstall and now won't sync.
why do email ID and password Aap email id qu magate ho eese aapako kayaa 👎👎
The notification and alarm functions don't work.
Just 5 habits free !!!!!!
No longer reminds me to do stuff. Looking for another app now.
limited number of habits only 5
App keeps crashing
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this
Does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading. Unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me. Do not recommend. Waste of time.
Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application. I've lost all my progress that I've been tracking from 300 days. Shittiest app ever.
Can only track 5 habits at a time
Really liked the app and have been using premium but now I want to transfer to a new device. I can only doing this by signing up but whenever I go to the sign up section and type my email and password nothing happens and it asks me to sign up again. Really frustrating. If you guys can solve this it will definitely be 5 stars.
Limited free goals.
U bought the app but can't reach my premium account
Limited to 5 habits in the free trial. Waste of time. This is not a useful free trial for me. I have 7 things I'm tracking
I have tried a lot to set up reminder..but unfortunately it's not working which is pretty excruciating as a new user. It seems good initially but this is pissing me off. Do ler me know I can fix up this ..
Force closing on Android 10
Haven't been able to get a reply from customer support since August 2019 - if you can't get your email registered you can't use this across multiple devices. Super disappointed.
I've been using this since 2015.now with new phone. It didn't sync and expect me to upgrade again. Fix it please. Else. It will remain at 1 star. My feedback 👆🏼 posted few weeks ago was ignored. Uninstall for good!
Was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working.
Only 5 habits
DON'T PAY FOR THIS APP IT'S OUTDATED AND NOT SUPPORTED BY DEVELOPPER ANYMORE.
Last updated 2018 really!!!! I am a premium user and it crashes sometimes. Bad investment.
"After purchase, sync is not working. Then y sholud I purchase this app. Profile name is empty, while editing it says ""something went wrong"". And app is completely crash now. Not at all opening."
Only 5 habits. If you dont want to pay it's not worth having.
Such a bad experience. I bought the app and now it says they can't find my email id in their database. I am trying to reach them for 4 days. No response. just automated mails. so pathetic.
Stupid app
It doesn't work or show any reminders whatsoever and no picturea as it says. I wasted my money
Sync problem is a deal-breaker. All that info is now lost. I used it for over a year. :(
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...
I'm unsatisfied with this application Not show negative feedback so it can't best app
Twice lost all data b/c wouldn't sync. Had over a year of data. Had premium and still didn't make a difference. Moving on. Just done. So upset!
The Premium version of the App does not sync across multiple devices. I use an android phone and a chromebook and it still does not work. Don't bother with Premium.
I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.
Guess I can't use this app after paying for premium 😧
"App was good in past but not anymore, it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since. As per details in app Page, last update was on 28th Jun 2018, but still it is the first thing that comes in results when I search for ""Habit"" 😲 I guess Google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years."
Not updated anymore. Unstable
NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.
Ugly ui jiss. Fb login dosent work.
I bought the Premium version and it will not sync. I have snet numerous requests to support and have received no responses
Spamming me to rate. Well here you go....
App crashes
This app lost all my data. I would sync every day but when I had to reinstall and tried to sync-nothing. I had paid the money for premium but now it wants me to pay again.
"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits."""
Premium does not work. False advertising!
How do i get a refund?
I was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features. But they took the money and provided nothing at all. I tries contacting the developer via Email and no answer at all. Stay Away.
Vorrei avere indietro i miei soldi visto che il login non funziona e che non sembra esistere un'assistenza tecnica. I want my money back since I cannot login
"Don't install this app.This is forgery. I've used this app for more than 2 years when I changed my mobile phone I couldn't login when I logged in it says ""this email account is not in our database"" I have the mail to prove that I had had the account in the App.I mailed the company 4-5 times but there's no reply. 2 years of my habit data is lost."
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking."""
This app doesnt sync data.
Sync not working. Don't buy in-app purchase.
Paid for premium. Does not sync.
Failed to connect to Facebook
Facebook login fails with an error from Facebook saying the login method hasn't bee implemented correctly.
Lost all my data when I moved to ios
Hyper masculine tone is very off-putting and irritating. Hint to developers: Women try to change habits too! At least give us the option of just having hints in our own words...
It's working anymore after paying for premium
Does not log in. After 5 minites it's still trying to log itself in.
"Had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting (now using a different app.) This pathetic app that I paid premium for, would not sync. ""Check internet connection"" every damn time. I paid for the damn app, sadly probably past my refund day!"
Online sync is no longer working and last update was June 2018 which is more than a year. Is there a reason why I should continue using this app?
"""High background usage"" Sorry, can't waste my battery spyware like this"
Please ADD REMINDER 😭 or show me how to sett
Lies! No multi-device syncing on premium
Premium subscription for such a simple app is greedy.
Files Lost Forver. No updates and broken
awsome application.. i purched it.. but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock .. plz add this type of features.. the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen From last 10 month it's not getting synchronising.. Plz do something @developer We paid for it
Only 5 habits
Can't sign up with email!!
Will not let me register. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Tried both the email login and the Facebook login.
Need more habit columns for free
No longer syncs.
Sync not working anymore
I have paid for the premium features but the sync is not working. I mailed them but got no response
The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.
Only 5 habit you can update
Very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber. Strongly recommend against this app. Not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails.
Sync isn't working. No response to emails. No updates for ages.
It's been 1 week since I'm using the app. The reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning. Really disappointed. May be uninstalling the app after few days. Hope this helps.
"I bought premium and now I can't login to the app using Facebook. (and I can't login any other way) I get this message: ""Login Failed: You can't use Facebook to log into this app or website because there's an issue with its implementation of Facebook Login."""
Like another commenter said. Just installed it on new phone and even though signed in it doesn't give my my paid for premium. Previous phone checked the sync and last sync was 128 days ago.
not free
Sync doesn't work
Takes ages to load each time I open it up. Used to be good. Time to say goodbye
"Pathetic. I was totally in love with this app until I changed my phone. I lost the phone, and when I installed the app in my new phone, everything was gone. My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost. There's no way to restore my data or contact the devs. If you cannot save on JSON file of mine in your cloud, please explain why I should buy premium? There is a sync option in the app. Don't tell me I should have manually ""synced"" my stuff"
Can't log in with Facebook.
Reminder did not appear
Unnecessary limiting of number of habits to be tracked. Use Habit loop app instead
App is not supported anymore and syncing not working
Reminder does not work
Appears to be an abandoned app.
Synchronisation is not working. It's dishonest to sell a service that doesn't exist 😬
No quotes
The user interface is not user friendly No one likes to use a complicated app to build habits which will make their work even more harder Make it simple and easy to understand man
It is difficult to understand
The widgets do not work. Please add auto back and provide some analytics/graphs on the habits management and formation.
Like many premium users I received an automated email letting me know that following a bug my password was reset. After that impossible to use the premium features any more. Developer doesn't respond. Such a shame!
Reminders are not on time!
Won't allow me to register or make an account. Tried to set up without on to try it out but as soon as you lose the app the habits you have set up disappear! Not the best trial!
Reminders ain't working!
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.
Free account limited to 5 habits
Complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest. Atleast widget should be available for trials.
Only the premium version is good for use free version is a waste of time
Only 3 stars because after the first 5 options No more Then u have to pay
Can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation. Uninstalling
Reminders haven't been working.
Sync no longer working:(
"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars."
Unable to import any data from the .csv file in cloud!!! No option to get any data back! Bought premium and im not happy. Beware!!!
Loading takes too long and reminders don't work.
The moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired. Needs better moderation.
Sync no longer works. Also app has been buggy lately - closes down and does not respond. I'm now using Loop Habit Tracker which is more stable.
"I've been using this app for more than 5 years, it was great. But currently I changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn't work anymore :( It says something like ""no internet connection"". So at the end I have to use another app."
Mixed great app but don't by premium. Won't work without play services and developer unresponsive
EDIT/UPDATE - Purchased premium. Sync doesn't work. A quick glance at developers FB/Twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth (no activity since 2018). App hasn't received an update since 2018. My suggestion: pick an app that's still actively developed. Exactly what I have been looking for. Fantastic interface and thoughtful design. I'm hooked guys!
The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.
I liked the app until it told me I could only have 5 goals. :(
Only 5 items on free version. Would be nice to have that clear so I don't have to waste my time and give out my email.
Love and use the app BUT sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing.
The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.
DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.
Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.
Too much fluff. Difficult to see the actual progress.
I bought the premium. And I can't sync the data between my devices.
I've set a reminder for me to drink water... It doesn't remind at all!!!
Paid widget feature!!!!! One thing that downplays all other.
Does not sync
worked okay for awhile. sync between devices no longer works and I have the paid for premium account. uninstalled on both devices. sync fails on both
No notification of Habit tracks
"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium."
Desde hace unos meses no sirve la Sync ni me deja entrar a la cuenta
Cannot sync. What is going on?
The app doesn't really look like the screenshots. It's also quite outdated in design. If you don't mind paying for it then it gets the job done.
please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app😥 i can't live without this feature
not a bad app but DONT pay for the premium. The widgets dont work!!
unable to register via manual and via fb
A little too confusing.
good
the app requires premium membership to use the widget. defeats the point for me
I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.
couldn't login with Facebook
It is completely failing on reminders!
Please change the logo
Terrible UI
the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free
it's not worth the premium. I tried to get a refund because it wasn't what I thought it would be and no one has contacted me. They claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer. I will be deleting this app and regretting the $8 purchase
There needs to be an option on when the habit starts
Awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of $5 its about $10 for me with tax included. Also I don't appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33% claimed discounted price very deceiving. Lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019.
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.
"I could not figure out how to set reminders. And I did NOT want to ""register"""
I love the ease of the application and the setup. I don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame-based. it doesn't make me want to try any harder when I get scolded for not fulfilling my goals. positive encouragement as the best way.
I want to start my week with Saturday and it is not available! only can change between Sunday & Monday !
useless! you need a premium account to use Widgets
Started off really well but has stopped working properly now. Great shame as it has a lot of promise.
Crashes on sign in on my Pixel 2 XL
stuck on setting up your account
Reminders are not working. I have an Asus ZenFone 4 (shouldn't matter) and I have set the reminders multiple times with no success. I feel this is the most important part of this app as I need reminding in order to affectively create a habit. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. My rating my change after feedback.
Two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year. Is this application still supported by the dev team?
I didn't like it.
none of the notifications work. other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix. the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications
I don't like the layout at all. I want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks.
Love the app. Would love a version for Windows/Chrome to use on PC. Also I bought a premium version and now when I opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the non-premium version.
Paid for this years ago and used it on another device. Now I have a new phone and when I'm trying to login it says my email address is not in the database.
It stops sending notifications randomly.
Good concept with poor design. The widget needs a redesign - currently it wastes a lot of space on my homescreen. The forum section is good.
I like the overall app. It is the best. But even after setting the reminder for my habits. I do not receive any notification or reminder. I have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on.
Please don't call me darling! My app reminder called me darling. Not cool!
Works OK on Galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications. Can't even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts. In the end all data lost and so am I.
Free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing
Only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to PAY for more. Always about the money. Sorry I wasted time on setting this up.
"Almost 3 years ago I liked it enough to purchase it. Then they decided to make it a monthly fee. I found this out when I reloaded it onto my phone. I emailed them to find out if my previous purchase was valid or if it was applicable to the new version and they never responded. Even a simple ""no"" would have been fine. So, I found another habit tracker that I actually prefer."
Didn't like it
Lost my premium and all my habits gone when I changed my device. The app was great but doesn't seem good for long term use.
The fact that with the free version doesn't let someone track more than 5 habits it's a shame
Worked for about a day and then just crashed repeatedly so have uninstalled. Disappointed as looked really good
I think it's really petty that the widget only comes with a premium account. No thanks.
I'd give it five stars but it keeps bugging me to rate it.
"Pointless to be honest...may as well use a notebook. DOESN'T TRACK HABITS. 
Yes, you have to MANUALLY do everything...my time is to valuable to waste 
on this garbage."
"Perfect. Purchased it. Though I really really wish for a chrome extension, 
so that I can access it on my computer too. EDIT: Like many others, my 
premium account is gone too. I don't mind purchasing it again but what if 
it goes missing again???"
"I would give 5. But the reminder is not working. And I wish the app had a 
way to report such bugs. Uninstalled"
"I have purchased full version of this app. The functionality of the app is 
good but many features are not working properly. Eg. Starup on Montly view 
is not working. Additionally there is absolutely zero response from the 
developers on reporting the bugs"
"App was well organized and easy to use, but you had to pay money to have 
more than 5 habits to track. Not realistic for me to only need 5. 
Uninstalled it."
"Please help me. I really like this app. But my premium purchase with my 
facebook account is gone. Recently I have trouble with the app. It stops 
everytime I opens. Then I uninstall, and reinstall it again. But it 
continues to stop. It turns out that the problem is I disabled Chrome. 
Because after I installed and update Chrome, the Habit Tracker worms again. 
However, my premium purchase is gone and I can't seem to redeem it."
"This app is crashing whenever I try to mark as task completed on a 
particular date."
Constantly tells me to provide a rating
"Like the way it presents the stats. Would like to suggest a collaboration 
concept with other users (such as via Google) where one can view and 
comment his/her mate's lists."
"App is great, but it crashes on month view and when trying to edit habit on 
my Xiaomi Redmi Note 4"
"like the app but dont like how I purchased premium on one device and can't 
get my premium features anywhere else"
Sync isn't working. Lost my data again....
"Sorry for the poor rating but your app has a major bug. Swiping up or down 
while viewing details for a month/habit makes the interface jump to details 
for another habit randomly. It's a pain to realise midway that suddenly you 
are reading incorrect data. Happens so many times that it's not funny. Will 
be looking for alternatives to your app"
"Great design except they hide the fact you can track 5 on the free version 
until you go through the process of adding all five individually then you 
find out you can't add anymore without premiuthem, freemium is fine, hiding 
the cut off wall is not."
"This is a great app. It gets two stars because I paid for it but it 
frequently nags me to review it. Well, here's your review."
Cluttered and unintuitive.
The app crashes and closes when trying to sync. I have the platinum plan
"Has great potential but it kept crashing when I clicked the monthly view or 
the weekly view. Also reinstalled the app, and when I created my first 
habit it crashed again."
"Too spammy. Repeated notifications pushing for a rating. I rated, then 
uninstalled."
"I paid for this app yet it stopped working after I logged out one time. It 
refuses to let me back in when trying my password and even after I tried 
changing the password multiple times. There is no contact information on 
their website. :("
"Habit sync does not work. I must create the same account over and over 
again. Frustrating."
"Not interested in people's masterbation habits. The community news feed was 
full of people tracking their jerking off ... no thanks. Don't want to 
know. Uninstalled."
Only track 5 habits for free!
"Pretty nice app, but unstable a bit: sometimes drops settings like ""show 
monthly/weekly"". And a big trouble: Used it for 3 month. Had troubles with 
signing up at start and gave up - I used it without account just on one 
phone. About a week ago received strange email about password from support 
(they have my email but didn't sign me in?). Looked strange, frankly 
speaking, so I ignored the email and decided to try to register one more 
time. I used option ""sign up with facebook"", was glad to see title ""without 
data loss"" and when i finally registered... all my habits and data 
disappeared from interface. Sent email to support with screens and 
description, but silence still."
"It's a good app but just list my premium account and all my data. Luckily I 
saved it. How do I get it back?"
The reminders never work.
"It has all the features but it doesn't work properly. I have a 5 days 
streak and it says 7. I have 3 and ut counts as 0. There are major errors 
here and it's frustrating."
Widgets require premium
It doesn't let you have more than 5 habits without getting premium
"I paid for premium some time ago. Just got a new phone and installed the app, and was unpleasantly surprised to find that my email address ""was not found in our database"". This apparently means that all my synced data, habits, and history are completely gone. I created a new profile with the same email address, but the app still does not appear to be syncing at all. I'll continue to use the app for now, as I still like it best out of all habit trackers, but be warned there is NO backup/sync support here."
How can I delete my account? All I see is an option for deleting data
Does not load
Until recently I enjoyed the app but somehow my purchased Premium status is not recognized anymore. Contacted the developers by email but got no response. So sad :-(
I bought the premium version and sometimes a habit won't chain-link between successful days. You have to delete and recreate it then it will chain-link between successful days again.
"Android widget not working. It shows the tasks but when I click on the ""circle"" to mark it as ""done"" nothing happens."
Widget only for premium account
The motivational photo is missing
Whyd it log me out..... Edit: the push notifications dont push anymore
I love this app but the widget doesn't work most times which is very annoying
I dont know how its work. I wanna give it 5-stars but when alarm is once set and when it rangbit dosnt stop untill u switch off the phone.
Decent app for habit tracking. Unsubscribing from their premium membership is a headache.
"Nice app... But need to fix some bugs.. First app crashes when I click on ""Go premium"". Also even if I am connected to wifi some big image is not loading on home screen. Wondering what's that image..."
It is great for keeping track of my habits but I never get any reminders. I've checked my phone and all the permissions are there but still no reminders. I just get a tiny message that tells me the app is running but disappears without doing anything. I'll persevere a bit longer but if it doesn't remind me there isn't much point as I will forget to do things.
Too costly for premium
In theory it helps track habits but after 30 or 40 days the reminders stop appearing randomly then just disappear completely. Rest of the app works well. Perhaps its my device but be aware.
Not used
Super easy to use. Less friction. I like how users can discuss progress with each other. It's very helpful.
Looks like a powerful tool but the UI is a dealbreaker for me. Hopefully it receives a major redesign in the future.
👌
Its okay. Premium version is more useful
It is a good app I've been using it for quite some time and I think I m progressing and this really is helping me. Just a bit dissapointed bcs it doesn't have a full progress tracker as a graph and I wish they will install this feature nearby in the future hopefully.
It's about what I'd expect from a habit tracker. I chose this over another one for the motivational quotes. Only they just just up as the error picture icon without the actual picture. if I can't get the picture can I at least get alternative text for the picture that has the quote? Moto z2 force
I wish there are better graphs to see the dips and raises in my performance. The current one is way too compressed and looks just like a straight line inspite of the dips
The app is great now some bugs are fixed. Notification/reminders still don't work for me. $6.99/month seems steep to record more than 5 habits.
Good
I think I like it but not fully sure yet. Was getting daily notifications then they stopped and I forgot all about some habits. Will restart again.
The app design could be better
Great app . could you guys add a option like task archive because there are some habits like typing practice i want to follow and don't want to delete the data Give a option to hide the habit without losing data
I was unable to create checklists in the way I want. I'm better off using Microsoft Excel
Nice one but it's expensive
Why is it called Habit Bull upon installation and it also has a different app icon? Misleading...
Good app but it doesn't have riminder as it says.
Nice and easy way to keep track of your streaks and habits. Also pretty cool that there are comment boards so you can interact with people doing the same things. Nice to get encouragement and share tips. Really cool app overall.
Pretty good app
Nice app.
Ok
Not totally friendly environment
Pretty good app but the continuous nagging to rate it in the Play Store gets annoying in a hurry.
I like the alerts .. it's a good free app.. I think it be nice if I could click the day then get an option for if I completed my task or not.
Still learning to use it
It's good! Easy to use.
Would need an UI refresh.
Wish I could track more than 5 habits without paying.
Great app
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.
There's this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons. Please fix it!
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
best habit tracker ✓ edit- can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph? It's not accurate- always trending down no matter what.
Facebook login not working
I am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty .
This deserves 5 stars. But I am not able to see discussions since the last one week.
Probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous.
I really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track. Simple but effective. I used the free version for almost 2 years. At the end of the first year it reset and I lost all of my history. So before the end of the second year I bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again. I contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all. I still recommend it for tracking your habits but don't expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it
Really enjoying this app but wish I could track more than 5 habits!!
Too invasive and complicated.
Nice app
It delivers what it promises
"It's a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits. I had been gifted premium early on, but I've found that the features have disappeared and I'm only seeing the base version. I like it enough that I want to buy it, but I worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews. I've also found a bug: when I have a goal set to 3x a week as ""success,"" the app doesn't recognize when I've had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section, whereas it's at 80% in the ""percent success"" section and many weeks of meeting my goal."
It's good app But it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit
Odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally
The interface is intuitive. I am giving a three because my online data did not sync when I upgraded.
No of activities that we can add is only 5 that's why i give this 3 🌟
pretty good app
This app is good but I can't access 5 habit because I need premium to access it 🙅🤷
Does exactly one thing - tracks habits - but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras (or ads). Clean interface. Sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work. No way to transfer data.
I liked how I could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps (I had to input myself) and my notifications would only go off if I opened the app myself. Kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications...
The sync feature doesn't work.
Limited functionality but reliable.
Went for the premium subscription without a doubt. Definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly. Edit: Everything's good but after changing phones I've suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesn't work.
The app is great. I wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things. For me the notifications don't work unles I open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed.. other then that easy app to use and navigate.
Don't get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times!
Pretty average app
The Reminder option is not working....I have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but Unfortunately....The basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work....kindly help by resolving this issue... Color code Options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit
A great way to track goals but quite limited in functionaliry and the Google fit integration doesn't work.
Could do with a reward or goal feature when habit followed.
It's an okay app but I have found better ones such as I am sober. This needs to be paid for to be useful.
The app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that I have logged in ☹️
The free app is too limited. Other than that it's a good one!
I just started using this app. my week actually starts with Saturdays while only Sundays and Mondays are mentioned. if you could modify this detail that'd be really appreciated 🙏
Synching between my Chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app. The color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive.
App is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot don't opens the app. Evertime i need to log out and again log in it. Plz solve my issue
I really like this application. Very well done!  My reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security. No option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information.  PLEASE ADD SECURITY!
Good app but faulty notifications. The notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if I open the app. By that point it's too late. I need the reminders to work to be effective. I purchased the full version.
It's ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages don't change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker. The App's look doesn't come exciting to look at as well.
I paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation. They fix that problem.
shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly. otherwise all around good app.
😀
good
it’s a great app and works great. helps me keep track of whether or not I took pills or did excercises or not. However it lacks the feature of ”multiple times a day” So if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day. this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once. Does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature?
I bought the paid verison. It does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers. But habits aren't as simple as it is... we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time. If I want to develop a habit of waking up by 7.. it shouldn't be a yes or no question... I should be able to enter the time track it over the month.
I really like the app. Maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more
Good
Good app but only counts by day. 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well.
nice but no daily notification come
unable to set custom notification sound. it uses default sound even after changing. others looks good.
"Good function, weird execution. The program works great, but it has weird way of reminding the user of the habit. like saying Hey, tiger"" its just weird"
love it
Good app. Minus one star because of the constant nagging. And that's in the paid version. :-(
Ok app
"Great for progress. Their motivation quotes stopped working. Plus it doesn't remember which habit you were last viewing... so a pain in the ass ""weekly"" intrusive display. I specifically looked for this app. Because it's simple and easy on the eyes."
Great for creating or breaking habits. Thanks so much.
Great
Solid habit tracking app. Great for what I needed it for.
Works Great! I use it for almost everything. Especially when taking a new medicine or starting a new thing I want to continue
Works well and I love the cheery greetings.
Good
Would love to see a yearly review .. Other than that awesome app
Nice app. I wish there was an option to move a goal though. For example I want to workout 3 days a week. This app has you choose 3 set days. I don't necessarily know my schedule and would like to move around a goal. Otherwise I dig.
Great
Easy to use.
Have used this app for almost two years. I loved the minimalistic features despite all other confusing apps out there. It would be great if worked on making it an aesthetic user interface .
I really like the app. However few weeks ago I've changed my Phone for new one - Samsung Galaxy A51 and now I've problems with a widget. Sometimes it is posible to check that habits are done with the widget and sometimes it is not. It looks like the widget just freeze. Can you help me?
Very Good For Habit Maker
I like it for a free app.
Good
Helpful for building habits
Very good App to track good habits
The inspiration posters are not loading/viewable
When I add time to the habit it is in decimal so week and month totals are incorrect eg. 1.30 + 1.40 is according to app 2.70 while it is 3.10 actually.
The app helps me a lot. I would like to have more information about the action and habits tracking into an online dashboard
I enjoy watching my habits become habits everyday. I just wish there was a theme I could use
Good for me
Good simple app. But sometimes it doesn't download
Works very well.
Can we please add number of days per fortnight as an option to select along with week month and year
The tracking system is good
Easy to use and customize. Only 5 habits without premium payment.
Good application
Very good app and it helped me to form habits.
Very basic but helps keep track of things
Too overloaded main screen
App is nice but somehow i m not able to delete the habbit which i recently added by mistake .pls guide
"Efficient after set-up. Makes tracking easy. Would like to be able to set incriments on each individual category. Not a plus or minus ""1"" only"
Very good!! Could use some more flare. :)
Update on 8/13/20 fixed the reminder notifications. Thank you!
It is a great app. Maybe it could have a more attractive interface.
Good app to track your habits and build on good ones
This app is very good
Good reminders for habit formation
Good
A really easy way to track new habits. I have looked at other apps and this is much easier. Thank you HabitBull.
Very nice app......
A very simple habit tracker. Easy to use.
Useful
So far so good! It does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after I've exited the app though... bit of a weird bug.
Motivational and funny remiders really help in pushing to do the task
Good
Sync doesn't work
👍🏼
Nice app. the icon got problem.
Nice
An improvement would be to see running total on all habits page. Quite expensive for what it does
Good
Good app
good app...but they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits
Its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict.
Very useful and encourages motivation
Notification features should be free.
Good
Very conveniant and useful. The reminder function is also really nice to stay on top of activities.
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!
loving it so far! keeps me motivated :)
Good as motivation to track and tick off daily goals.
Good app. No lags. Does what it says. I'm happy.
Happy to see my progress. It's a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which I paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life.
I'm a big kid. I'd love it if the circles you tap to colour in were star shaped.
It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.
If wish the images of quotes would have the previous option too
I like the app but dont like the big list of discussions about guys not trying to masterbate at the bottom.
It helps me to change my habbit
Simple but effective.
Wish it had a little more options but still great and easy app
This has been a great app to build habits. I would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time. You can get more but theres a pay wall
"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful."
Great tool
Very good quality app for habits
Simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals
Very Helpful app for us to quit/join any kind of habit With the help of this app i have now completed my 60 days of no smoking challenge Thankyou habit bull
Already helped a lot. Wish it had more colors.
Good habit tracking app!
"Tracks many tasks in great detail (statistics available on averages and streaks, etc). It has progressive tasks, so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily (like drinking water) and come up with more info than ""pass/fail"". My only qualm is the color. The display is very busy and colorful. I would also like a quicker interface for ""progressive"" tasks."
Why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same
Great app
"Wonderful app! I'm just wondering if I overlooked something, because if, for instance, I set a habit to ""every 3 days"" but end up doing it every 2 days instead, the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail? Which seems very strange to me, since I actually did better than needed!"
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.
It's a little too early to tell. So far pretty good.
Really remarkable app.
Get me focused and motivated
I liked this app it is really helping me and reminding me to do things on time and I am able to be proactive
Sehr hilfreich.
Home
Genial!
Can UI can be improved to add habits with more customisation.
great!
Numerical entries should default to the previous days value
Easy to use and helpful to keep good habits on track.
C'est bon
Loved it. Motivates me to keep me on track with my set targets.
Ok
I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).
Bug has been fixed! Now i can use it with all my devices!
Great tool!
Useful app
Good app really helpful....but i think it should include permanent tracker in the dropdown menu
Great to get started with a healthier lifestyle.
Great for keeping track of my workout and non drinking days.
Free and easy to track ur new habits
Great!! its simple....
Good app to track habits
Animations are a bit choppy and mediocre design but great functionality
only 5 hapits for free
Easy to use but it seems really basic
Love it except I can't change the positive memes at the bottom anymore.
Great app... I am using it for a while... Functionality wise it the best in the market... It can get updated in terms of visuals and performance
UI/UX can be improved a bit more
i like the design
Heyyy dear Developers..!! Love the app.. but have a issue in it.. IDK if it is only with me.. the App doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal.. only 1st day it does..
Extremely easy user interface. Helpsnin using the app more and note the goals.
It is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not
Amazing experience
Best habit tracker app i have used
Easy to use and very flexible.
Great way to hold yourself accountable for setting goals
It's cool because it's gives me motivation to push myself and allow me to see my struggle in addiction for every day I fail.
Worked well for my purposes
Love the reminder to log your habits
Works well. The interface is a little odd. You have to scroll down to see all the graphs.
Simple app that provides all I need to track habits. UI could use a refresher.
This is closest to my expectations
it works well for me
It would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbit..try not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app . Well built interface with motivational images loved it❤
Its useful
Very helpful
Would be perfect if you also have pomodoro/timer to do each task
Good visual reminder and nice to see patterns of habit breaking
I'm using the app for about a week. So far so wonderful :)
It is perfect.
Simple and amazing app.
Very good 😃
Wonder full app

Very useful and helpful app. Straighforward and easy to navigate.
I'm using the free version. Lets you have up to 5 habits. I like how customizable you can make the habit and what warrants success.
Simple & effective. I've used this a lot over the past few years & found it extremely helpful. Strongly recommend.
It pushes me from my comfort zone to do something important
Very good.
Gets the job done
Easy to use and has notification reminders
We appreciate your efforts to make this app soo complete and helpful. Thank you.

Enjoying the app. Keeping me accountable. Doing well because I want a good report card lol.

Easy to use. Simple. What I was hoping for.
The best I have ever used. The pop up reminders prevent me from skipping a day
So easy to use.
An awesome app
Easy to use
It's pretty simple and there are discussion boards where other people share their experience on similar experiences.
Wonderful app. It helps a lot on trekking my progress and motivates me not to give up
Good simple app. Does what it says and doesn't ask anything in return
This has been a great experiment...i really like this app. I feel motivated to see the check marks and have feelings of confidence!
I like this app. Would be good if you can implement option that allows miscellaneous days to count towards an activity. E.g perform a task 3 times a week (any non-specific day).
Simple yet useful... what a great app
Kisses for the developer
Good basic no- frills app
Super helpful and easy to use!
I have some things that I struggle with. This app has helped me to look at patterns and shows me physically what is happening in my life. It's very easy to use and you can track multiple things at once. I recommend giving it a try. .
So motivating! Wonderful app
Very good
I love this is apps.
Great app to track all your different kinds of habits and activities.
User friendly and highly customizable
Loving this app. It keeps me organized and I make myself accountable. Having the widget is definitely a constant reminder.
Good:)

This app is supperb.....from india.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I got a best friend in daily practice
Just came here after you becoming sponsor of rewirs channel in utube Well I am thanks full that I got to know about this app by rewirs (that is also a very gud channel)
Well it works for me. Seem to be keeping up with my habit. Slowly introducing a new habit every 2-4 weeks and building up my habits.
Easy to use.
Awesome app
Great aoo
Really easy app to use.
A very necessary app. It has changed my life very well. Thanks for creating this app.
Awesome app.
Latest update makes the widget not working
Pay!
The app sends too many notifications with annoying sound 😡
Not very intuitive
It takes forever to download
I haven't even opened this app and it's already drained 30 percent of my battery! Wow. Waste of time and space.
$50 for a simple app? No thanks.
This is a really dumb app.
This app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it. Very intrusive.
Is quite expensive
Tested on 4 Android versions and devices: 1• Reminders only work with screen on & app in foreground (app doesn't stay in memory!) 2• Can't rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom. 3• Every notification 'Perform' button click= annoying popup to confirm AGAIN- can't be disabled!! 4• Needs option for notification X minutes AFTER task start/end (Users need notification to inform what to start PLUS notification option to confirm it's done (at the task end time.)) Subscibe when fixed!
"This app will create a ""Review my tasks"" reminder when you launch it for the first time and by default will set the reminder to ""5 hours before"". This can mean it will wake you up in the middle of the night with this reminder playing a loud notification sound. It ignores the Do not disturb mode of the phone. It fails to show any visual notification so you will not know why your phone is making sounds in the middle of the night."
Too complicated UI design. I just need a mindless tracker
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!"
I just cannot be notified. Please. Fix it. So I could give 5 stars.
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.
Too much ads appeared out of no where.
Key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of $6.50 per month with the best deal. Simply shameless.
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.
"Notifications don't work. It's a shame, because I wanted to buy a subscription. [EDIT] Okay, I already know what's going on. The operating system of my smartphone is MIUI. This app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off. At the same time, in the application settings I have the option: ""No restrictions - battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity."" Other applications similar to this one (ToDo, habits) work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving."
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.
Подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения.
I'm sure the dev is well intended. Just no for me. UX is terrible.
"DON'T download. After installation my calendar was FULL of commercials! ""You won an iPhone"" events with alarms."
Tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re-open. Can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription
"read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription, they said all ""major"" features are available for free. No, no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty ""major"" in my book"
The pop up adverts are so loud ... Terible !
Decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to-do list is completely unacceptable. Take no for an answer.
very bad experience
Couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am
kicks me out of the game instantly. Not for me.
notification not working
Crashes on android 4.4 (miui 9)
Buggy! Won't let me edit rewards. No.
"Auto-fail only works if you go to each task? That's not auto fail. Makes no 
sense. Might as well go back to Life RPG. that feature was the only reason 
I even tried this. Subscription model ridiculous. Why would I pay a MONTHLY 
fee for some icons? They are helpful icons & necessary mostly, but that's 
just ridiculously expensive for some icons. A one time fee is reasonable. 
Even if it was like $5. I wanted to like this app, but this got in the way."
My entire plan was suddenly removed
This is worst task game in my life
Somehow bought it's own subscription? Then I had trouble cancelling. Was enjoying til it stole my money. I never saw any payment authorization window.
Uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature  ✔DONE
One of the worst in the genre
"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny."
Way too complicated to use. This app could be so much simpler. The time I've wasted on it is time I could be doing tasks.
It's not well organized. I couldn't organize my schedule nicely. I think it should be more simple and easy. Also reminder didn't work and i don't know why.
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.
Very useful but completely loses it's value when you don't get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others. Other times you don't even get any I mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don't even get the reminder? Please fix this problem.
Nice idea for an app but don't like the fact that you can't customize the hero to be a woman. Also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it. Edit - but there are no female icons.
"So cool, but insanely expensive. Also, wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual. I have no reading comprehension issues, there is just no ""getting started"" section or similar. Then I saw the fees, $50?! WOW that is high! I hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps & am a big fan of supporting developers, but $50 is nuts. This isn't a service one subscribes to, ex. Spotify, and $50 is NUTS to purchase an app. Not trying to be mean & am fine paying but $50 is way high."
A chore to figure out
notifiction is not working properly. When I set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line. App doesnot send me task notification about its deadline. Not Working
I had to put in all the info
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!"""
I liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them.
"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week"
It is complicated.
Price is very high for Indian users. We don't get 1/10 of what a US citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don't make a sense.
Is a pretty good app but it's got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things I've done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day?
Quite good one but I prefer single purchase option. But seriously I like the statistics. Well I saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup.
I'm not interested in subscriptions. One time fee would be fine by me.
Kind of ha are to get the hang of. Maybe I'm just stupid! IDK!! But I never did figure it out...
Convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking. Stats can't be reset. All the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled. It's also weird how 'done' can't be hidden.
"doesn't do what I need it to do with setting recurring alarms, such as every 3 hours forever. it just says ""how many times"" do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly. Just daily, weekly, etc."
"Repeats tick now...however I encountered another problem. There's no way to restore ""purchases"". Meaning if you subscribe and than reset/wipe the app or your phone, you can't use the subscription features anymore. And to get it back you have to completely resubscribe."
The ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous. Charge a single flat rate.  If the style does change to flat rate/ad free I'll gladly change my review.
So you reskinned LifeRPG? What's different here?
Refreshing tasks is a nightmare
Not a movable app
This is not an rpg!?!?!?! This is a goal tracker with an avatar. Ffs. So Useless.
Needs a dark mode.
"Almost perfect... I only wish it had more to do with the ""game"" aspect. It's basically a to-do list or planner. Sure, it gives you some ""gold"" and experience points based on your completed tasks, but they amount to nothing, as there is nothing to do with either once collected. No built-in items to purchase, no character creation or customisation... disappointing. That being said, the tasks are easy to create and customise. I feel more organised than usual. So, thanks, I guess."
I tried to set task to only do wednesday and friday and it wouldent work so I uninstaled. Apart from that its a good app.
Not for me. I was hoping for something with an alarm. Doesn't help if I don't get a reminder. Looks interesting though
"This app is incredibly unintuitive. Attempting to create an event with specific start and end dates is overcomplicated. I still can't get the ""specific dates"" option to function properly in the calendar. The app freezes if you delete the preset characteristics. This should not have left beta with so many duplication errors. Please fix this. I regret paying for this app. Edit: Additionally, deleting an occurrence of a reoccurring task only ones previous entries in it's place."
Działa ale zwykła aplikacja habits naprawdę wystarczy
Application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing - Duplicate Task feature doesn't duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated Tasks. So you cannot create a Template Task which could be used to create other similar deep Task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures. This is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently. Without this i will be forced to look at less
"This seems like a great app, but if you fall off the wagon or take a long vacation, with dozens of daily tasks, then there's no realistic way to recover, because you have to dismiss potentially thousands of pass/fails until you can get a list of just current and relevant tasks remaining for today. Multi-select helps, but still no good after a summer break, or older user with a 12 tasks triggering daily for a year = 4380 to dismiss by tapping each one. Could solve with a ""Select All"" feature."
Guys I really love this app and feature am.bkt confused of putting repeated reminder as am use to it and I love that reminder alarm to make me awake all the time I miss something. I can't find that or else please help me guiding for that..and also upload more videos on YouTube for new users to understand as you guys have hardly any video
I don't know how useful this will be yet. But I should point out that subscribing to your Instagram shouldn't be an infinitely repeatable task xD
"Fine for ""Daily grind"" tasks, but a hassle for spontaneous tasks. Not for those who lack patience. Like the design tho :)"
"The presentation is slick, highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to ""just do one more thing before bed time"". Liking it! It would have been an easy 5 star if not for the widgets. Unfortunately they do not continue the established level of customizability. Especially rescaling elements of the Ui of ""All Tasks"" to fit it into a smaller screen is missing. Further, there is a bug that ""All tasks are done"" after clicking away two tasks. Oxygen OS 10.3.3"
Too difficult
This could have been the one but I can't take pictures.
Too much lag & freezing
Good
Same review as rpg gamify
Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.
"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader."""
"Was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day, everyday. Duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way, but it clutters up the task list (like 8 lines so I'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water) and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list, both within and outside of the main task. I thought the ""repeat every 1 day, 8 times"" custom setting might work, but it's a different function."
I am in love with this app so far. I wish there was an iOS version available to connect with my friends though... I would recommend this to everyone otherwise! 3 stars for now due to limited availability.
App itself is nice but needs a lot of polish. Right now it's kind of a bugfest.
App crashing a lot. Do look into it and solve the problem asap.
A very good but incomplete idea. There is no way to track time spent on certain habits. there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour... Besides the statistics are super limited and basic.
The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily. Or maybe we can import (by purchasing) some set of quests. For me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered. would be use it furthere more if not too complicated
It would be great if the notifications actually works!! I don't get notified by any task I put in at all
Ok but doesn't feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall
"Setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it's good. The notifications aren't working on my phone, and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day, I'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird ""give me a notification 12 hours before"" The whole point of me getting a to-do list app was to have not only a list, but reminders, so until the notifications work I'll have to resort to a different app."
Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.
reminder doesn't work
"There could be any difference between gold that we earn. If my rewards are ""cheat meal"" and ""netflix episode"" and tasks are ""run 10 km"" and ""read a book"", it shouldn't be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book..."
It crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment. Why not just make it $5 lifetime? Seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar.
Everything requires you to pay money might as well make it a paid game instead of deceiving people for a free app
i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested 'to dos' cuz i can never think of things to do
The app is great but after using awhile it start to lag.
Too much paid only
This app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity
Needs fixes... Like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit... Looks like the developers don't use it themselves.
Suggestion: Can tasks take things from the inventory? Maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task.
"Don't like it very much, but I think it's just not for me. It's very complex and deep with tasks and such (I could even set the percentage of fear for a task... What??) so I didn't get very far before I just said ""forget it"". My life is too busy for such complexity."
"You're good guys. Your efforts are admirable Please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support ""rtl""."
"Uhm there's a little bug that I encountered, I cannot disable the skill 
decay :< pls fix I'll give 5 stars"
"Loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so I'm not using it anymore. I'll be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time. 
😊"
It is a good application. It is very useful. It is just okay.
Great app. Needs  a few things like task fail without consequences option. Mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase. Not every one has everything connected to Internet all the time.
It's such a spectacular idea but I had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day-to-day basis.
This is ok!  But it required bunch of upgrade and some new features!  Will keep it! But wait till is it perfect!
Good but not ok
Are there any guides out there?
It's a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time...
The concept is good. But why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though I have turned the notification on? This is very bad.
But then it started locking up everytime I tried to load it.  ←ved it until then.
"I can't be the only one multitasking. Therefore, I don't have time to figure out a basic program. I put in a picture and it was so tiny! I put in my tasks yet some are ""timeless"", some are daily, and there was powerlifting! I'm physically crippled!"
I need help from dev. One of my favorite apps of all time combines scheduling and rpg gaming in one not 5 stars because I bought premium but when I logged into my kindle premium status didnt show up neither did my other data from my phone please help devs!
"Just staryed using it. There's a pretty massive learning curve, especially when it comes to the complete customization of your character, characteristics, skills and in general ""finding the flow"" that works for you but so far it's been really helpful and an enjoyable experience."
Was really good but I think it'd be even better if it had a widget that could just take up a whole screen and mark complete on tasks from there
Ivery good app.. I would recommend it
I like alot about this app but really want to add one thing to make it round out my gamify experience. Skill tree. I would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills. Linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge. Some skills may need levels to unlock from other skills or need a basis in 2 skills to be usable. It really would make this app a huge step above any other gasification app.
I'm loving it so far. Is there any way to switch out the icons with some on the file system?
How i add multiple user profile
It crashes when you complete a task
For me is One of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning.
"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps"
Allows me take some of the real life out my responsibilities.
Some integrated examples would be nice also an inventory of items to help pick rewards but I have no income so I have to miss out on the good stuff
Bom
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great
Love the way this app is helping me. Its Great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system. 4 stars only because of app's free theme.
I love this app. I only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts.
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work."
Strong fallout/ skyrim feel. But full buy price is 45$? Even those games' price are lower on sale. And I bought them on sale. Other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars. And the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background?? I don't sub apps I buy them.Sub is for something like Netflix and Spotify...
I'll give it five stars when the widget stops resetting to nothing after I alter things within the app. I have to delete it off of my screen and put it back on in order for it to update.
I love this app and use it on my Android phone. Now I have an iPad and cannot find this app for it. Is there an iOS version available?
Good.
Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!
Good app. Minus a star as you cant manually sort task lists with your finger and change their priority that way
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks
It is a lot better than the other apps out. An 8 or 16bit UI makeover would be dope. The pixel look and feel. Always nostalgic
"It's a great app and very useful, but I would like for it to add an options. ""Delete after completion."" This means it would repeat until you hit the check button."
Works as expected but I would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise
It been running kind of slow when you're making new tasks
"Add ""negative habits"" which when done decrease coin, xp etc."
Nice app. Bug with achievement exp gained. It only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg( 144exp/25exp ). Why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it?
"Тарас это крутая идея и хорошая реализация. Доставляет кайф возможность разбивать дэйлики на подпункты (будет чётко если добавишь возможность автозавершения после выполнения всех пунктов). Система ачивок вполне юзабельно но нужно устанавливать ачивки на ""Habit generate"" - по типу 30 дней без перерыва и при желании по возрастающей 3 месяца и т. д Nexus 5x lineages OS 15.1 не работают reminders. Не готов брать подписку, но если добавишь отдельный платный контент (иконки или журнал квестов) - куплю"
It's helping me the way i think
"I am liking it, the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh, especially for the full buy out at 50+ dollars. A suggestion, I'd like to see two categories under the ""Skills"", one that says ""Increasing"" and one that says ""Decreasing"". I am trying to set up a ""Daily Grind"" negative skill that decreases ""Will Power"" and ""Motivation"", while increasing ""Submission"" and ""Routine"". I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!"
I really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 24/7.
Homescreen widget would be nice with more display option such as the progress bar.. etc
Awesome
I really like the app. I'm having an issue though where the widget doesn't populate when a new day starts. I have to delete it and readd it or restart my phone.
I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits
Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?
Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.
Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though
Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..
COMPLETE! A tip: The task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability
The app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks.
It keeps reminding me even after the Task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times I should be notified. But overall nice app.
Treating activities like a game Gives me a sense of accomplishment when I successfully finish my duties and earn XP.
Good
The apps are functioning well and recommended trying for RPG theme if you love RPG 👍but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate..
Very interesting application just to complicated for me
Nice
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.
Jibj
It٬s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable
fun and productive
"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""📚📗📘📙📓📔icon, or ""pen""🖋🖊 icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. 👍"
easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day
Crashes when I customize my hero status
Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.
"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!"
Fun and easy to use. Creative and helpful way to track tasks and habits.
I can't sign in neither with my google account nor with gmail. should I do something to be able to do that? or it's just a bug?
Simple and straightforward
"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue. It is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks."
this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work!!! im ao happy you listen to your customers EDIT: now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold.
eu daria 5 se estivesse totalmente traduzido para português
Keeps me on track!
Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!
needs more ranks.
"Productivity gamefied! As has been said before, the natural successor to LifeRPG. Looks like they just ripped the source code tbh, but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs. Pity they monetised it in every available orifice, fukugly full screen ads, in-app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription, all conspire to overshadow the app itself, as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its ""gaming"" USP."
"A good app in general. I would love to be able to have ""loose"" tasks, for example: practice spanish twice a week. Which should be completed at least twice every week. Also, why not allow icons to be any emoji?"
So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!
This would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem I didn't like. You can't choose PM or AM times and it's just a annoying and confusing.
I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.
I really like it. I wish the icon could be custom made. For example IF I could use my own png files as icons that would be cool. Especially for achievements.
Why this app consumes so MUCH traffic in background? This month it hit the 500mb (!!!) in bg. Is this app free of malware elements?
Fun way to track and reward yourself guilt-free. Lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice. My only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section.
"Update: Thank you for the fix, also if possible, can you consider adding an 
icon (a way) for quickly go to subtasks? (It helps User Experience a lot 
because now, we need to click / hold 2 times for go to subtasks of a parent 
task, and it takes a lot of time for the tasks with many level. I already 
update the rating, please let me know your feedback for the above and when 
the new update is available, i will change it to 5 stars Regards, ----- 
Please fix the ""Add subtasks"" feature in Subtasks list of a parent task 
(When clicking on ""Edit"" icon, it show list of subtasks to select, and a 
""Add subtasks"" link, but click on it show nothing) -> It affects User 
Experience a lot because when we need to add subtasks, we need to ""back"" a 
lot to go to main task list -> then add normal task -> then go to parent 
task to mark it as subtask Thank you. It is urgent so please let me know 
your feedback then I will increase the rating"
"Reward section should be devided into multiple catagory like item, armor, 
food etc to avoid difficulty in selecting one we want to buy with gold.. or 
you could add the feature to add a tast to costomable group we can create.."
"I like this update.. however i still think this app could be better in UI.. 
in future, could you add the visual improvement like adding progress bar in 
each characteristics and skills so we can track our progress more fun.. 
also just suggestions you could add health and magic point like in real RPG 
game.. alot people would like that i guess.."
Excellent features but needs more exciting UI
"I quite enjoyed this amazing little app for a week then I realized I can't 
view my past before like 6 days, if I could save it somewhere in graph form 
that would've been the 5th star."
"It's a good app, but it would be better if more optiosns were added in the 
repeat section, like being able to choose the repeat to occur every 
second/third/etc day/week/etc"
So what is.the function of coins?
First app to actually motivate me.   Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the achievements have no automatic templates and can't be set with conditions connected to the auto-fail function. That would be great for building habits.
I love everything! I just want the XP bar to have a cool animation of actually filling up in front of me!!! It's the only reasons I still use RPG life...I know it's petty...but animations are important for an app
Like it so far! My only suggestion being a shop where you can buy icons or something. Gotta put use for the coins
"Excellent for what it advertises. I wish for a way to spend the gold or use the exp. that way it would provide incentive to ""play"" more for those who wish to use this app as intended."
This app so far has the cleanest ui of all the apps ive tried of this genre. The task set up is so quick to use and the duplicate feature??? Fantastic for someone like me who has to set up working out tasks with similar outlines. The one thing I'd say is additional icons and maybe a few templates to help people get started other than the default. Otherwise keep up the good work!
I really like the idea of this app. It's pretty easy to use and understand and if you liked D&D growing up it'll remind you of the character building/levelling processes (which is great). If I could make one suggestion; add a falconry guy to the avatars. 😉
Achievements should have reward options such as exp/gold.   Otherwise it is a neat app.
A bit of headache in beginning.. but awesome!
Great app. An alarm would be great with new or better icons in context with the app
I really like the idea and would of easily voted 5 on it but it has no alerts or alarms on mine to remind me to do the set task. Doesn't even send me a notification.
This is a good app for motivation
"I believe it's awesome. But for the next update can you please use "" : "" instead of "" - "" in front of numbers? It looks like a minus symbol!"
It was fantastic until it started freezing every time I went to tasks. Is there a way to fix this?
Love the app! I wish there were more features such as adding icons to tasks or adding a quest map.
Widget finished task should be gone. It bother me that it's still with my task at hand.
Nice app best of the ones ive tried. But really think about adding some graphics and a much less boring UI (look at SuperBetter for instance) also a 'multiplayer' aspect is a glaring omission that almost all your competitors have..  Try to have stats actually have some meaning or  a way for us to give them meaning.
"Edit: For some reason, the timezone of the app is not the same as my actual timezone. Tasks are ""overdue"" even though the day is not over for me... However, it's still a great app with lots of potential! I like the slick interface and the whole concept. Once you can differentiate the characteristics from the skills, the fun begins. Keep improving this app, it's definitely my favorite RPG lifestyle app."
Could we customize notification sound for successful tasks? I want to add final fantasy victory theme but still don't know how to... Besides that i really like this apps..
By far the most in-depth app of this style. Tried Habitica and others and they were so underdeveloped in comparison in my opinion.
Great software for those who want to succeed I have been using this software for a year and I am completely satisfied with it Install it right now
Perfect. I serched to many apps like this but finally i find you. Best app for upgrade your life. U are my hero and i am a premium User now. Thank you dear Dev. ♡
Really helps me to keep motivated to keep my workouts or chores. And its so easy to use
Best app
I love this app. Life is like a game for me and this application helps to improve myself in a fun way.
Love the app and the fact the devs listen and add new updates all the time
I just started the app a few days ago and I really like it. I told my kids it would have been nice to have this when they were young. The fight for chores might have been a little less of a struggle.
Great so far
Great app! It helped me get my life together.
This app has been life changing. Its perfect for people who are Strategic and motivated by growing as a person.
Excelente app e com possobilidades infinitas se você for criativo
Великолепное приложение. Отзывчивая поддержка. Отличный дизайн. Продуманная и удобная система развития. Очень интересно ставить себе и родным задачи и вознаграждение за них. Рекомендую.
I really like this app. I appreciate how much thought has been put into it but it is complicated app. I wish there was a video to understand all features even though the help document is quite thorough.
Good
挺好用的，挺好玩的，而且还可以同步。
Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at! My only feedback is that I wish the color of the widget changed to match the chosen in-app theme because the yellow list kinda sticks out from my background. Other than that the app is perfect! Thank a lot Levor!!
Very useful
It's great for planning out goals of any time frame whether it be short or long term. It's also extremely customizable which I adore a lot.
Great app. I would love to buy it for lifetime but the price is too steep for a student in india. Hopefully like Netflix and Spotify etc have done with their prices for india. You can give us some price which will be affordable in our country.
Fun way to manage tasks and improve yourself.
Such an organized convenient way to keep track of my life
They should change the name. Have no idea it would be awesome just from the name.
good. yes. me like
Don't import its resets evryfing to defult
This app has helped me keep on track and get better habits
Really motivates
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you Edit: Gonna subscribe soon! Can you add sounds when consuming items, please? Thanks!"
I have only had it for a few days and don't fully understand every feature.. but it is the only to do list app that has so far worked for me. Probably because of it being based on a reward system even if the rewards are only virtual.
Great app for goal setting & tracking in a gamified way.
I love it! Incredibly customizable. Keeps me on track to do the things I want to do!
Very Active App
I think it's a pretty straightforward app. It definitely helps when you need to place certain tasks throughout your week as a reminder.
Amazing! This app has had a really large positive impact on my life (in just a few short months). Would definitely reccommend ^-^
It's the best task gamification app I have ever seen Even if you don't need the gamification it's still better than most other to do apps in task organization Edit : if you are capable please add the option of adding files to tasks like some other to do apps
Love the app but i have a question. I have a morning routine set up with subtasks. Is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab? Also i would love it if i could order my tasks customly without having to assign a time to them. This is by far the best app i have found for setting to do's for yourself. As an adult with adhd I love the fun childish functionality without it looking like a childs game on my phone.
Encourages me to complete task
The developer is pure genius. Well execution on customizable gamification app execution. I have bought a subscription as soon as using it for 10 minutes. I would like to make a business inquiry. Is the contact information listed here updated? Do you check your e-mails often? I am looking for a firm communication channel with the developer.
This is a great app. I recommend a search bar though for both skills and characteristics
RPG bolado
This app is just what I needed to make progress on my goals. Contains a whole bunch of features and customisability. It is also easy to use. I only have an Issue with the Task List Widget not updating properly after completing a task.
I've been doing this for several days and it's been working wonders
Probably the best task managing app out there.
Awesome app overall. It would be great to see some kind of progress functionality inside tasks. For example counter 0-10(or any other number you input) for push-ups / book pages / words learned etc.
It's not that bad.
Awesome app The best i've ever used
Fun. Versatile!
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!
Very good app for complete tracking
Great App. Changing my Life
Really cute but I'm more into minimalist designs. It works really well tho if the interface seems like ur thing. I like that they have a reward system. I might just get it back just for that bc no other app that I've seen has that.
Best habbit app
Really fun and thorough ^^
I need more options of anything
BEST TASK APP EVER!!!!
i need the application thanks developers :)
Awesome
Exceptional.
This app is amazing I'm having fun just setting up that being said an optional progress bar for tasks would be really helpful
Excellent app.
Perfect!!!
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.
Beautiful and detailed app! There are two features that would make it more useful: 1) a counter to keep track of quantity (example: alcohol drinks); 2) a limit which causes a fail if you go over (example: limit 14 drinks in a week or 2 per day)
awesome
very good
It's a great app
Thanks for this perfect app. How I can use coins? How I can buy with coins??
Great idea. Managing yourself like playing game.
Fun way to track tasks
Nice app very use full
Amazing.
It's a really great app I love most that it reminds you about your tasks since I tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants it's easy and fun to use especially with the reward system I think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly I love the app it's perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need
It really really good.
Seems to be useful so far.
"Awesome app to gamify tasks. I've been using it for 3 months and I love many things about it. I won't write them because I can only type 500 characters. BUT I wish it could include ""time tracking"", like the one from Toggl. Also I strongly wish it could have a desktop version (and IOS). Another thing would be to sincronize with a google calendar, not only the one inside the app (I also think the calendar needs accuracy). Lastly being able to interact with other users and a ranking would be great."
The idea is just wow. Well executed.
Great work mates!
Great productivity app to stay organized
I really love this app It's fantastic in many ways. I wish I could adjust the overdue settings as tasks are set as overdue too quickly for me :)
Amazing
Does everything I want it to do and more!
Amazing app!! You can literally modify EVERYTHING into the way you prefer! It's a little complex but with only minutes you can understand it's interface and fall in love with it. I love it even more because you can go up levels and it makes really more fun doing your tasks! No ads and almost everything for free. Pretty amazing!
Hmm... I like it
This is my first time with a RPG but I love this To Do List.
Gufy
This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time)
So far loving this app
I enjoy this app because I am a task oriented person and I can see how much I have completed and the XP gaming quality to it makes me feel like I m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work
Very easy to personalise and use 5⭐
Very nice
This app is really great. Easy to keep track of all my many activities.
Best life rpg app that I could find. Support is very helpful and fast at responding. Everything other app I tried was all about them milking money. But not this one.
Great! It's been helping me a lot
Es buena para aser mis abitos y mis tareas tiene muchas occiones
One of the bests to-do apps.
Good apps
Fun way to celebrate your accomplishments!
Been using the app for a couple of weeks and have lost 4lbs already. Took a bit of setting up with the tasks and rewards but it is very customisable. Gamifying my life might be just the thing I need to get into better habits and lose some weight!
Best motivational game style to do list app I've tried. Subscription cost is very reasonable and the free version is great too. Definitely recommend!
Amazing app!
This app makes me so much more productive
Great app
It's a really great app. Although it would be better if you could use costom icons for tasks and rewards and it would be better if the app didn't blur low quality pictures (as I like to use pixelated pictures). I also love the fact that this app works offline. Thank you for the great work 👍
Estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse.
Very neat
"First of all it's an excellent app. I like the fact that it is highly customizable. However, I'd like to make a suggestion. Your app lacks the ""emotional"" aspect a bit. I suggest to add support of small custom avatar-like images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons. This way a task will associate with something positive/inspirational. Pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen. Do not understimate the power of visual associations."
C'est la meilleure application pour vaincre la procrastination
In a weird way its cool to level up doing mundane tasks.
great app for a to-do list with a hint of gamer mentality
Great App! I paid for the pro version. I like the customice options to create character traits and unique skills. Pls upload a yoga and a meditation icon :)
Very good so far.
Дякую
Good
I'm a gamer and dislike doing chores. This gives incentive
I have had zero motivation to do anything lately with the whole Cortana thing going on but this really helps me get things done
A frightfully creative and entertaining way getting your tasks done! 👍🏽
Good
Ok
Wonderful app. Thank you developer. Please keep update.
No end of task/ habit days. So useless
Its ok Missing so many features Not user friendly Realized that after got the paid version
Very Worst App........😠😠😠😠
Worst app
only 7 free habits
This what is really useful to me. It is useful to manage my time it is the good app for time management I prefer download this app and and use
This app is a scam it does not work at all nothing is real here from the first day I used it it refused to work at all
The have a limit on how much habits you can add for free. Going to u install
Bad app
no notification showing
Really? Dark mode behind a pay wall?
It is a super app. I wouldn't forget my activity
It was confusing
No reminders
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy."
Costs money to make pixels darker
Terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit? Stupidly paid for the premium upfront. Agree with others that idk where 4.6 came from.
It doesn't remind me. I even forgot I still had it on my phone.
Zero integration with any calendar so literally worthless!!
"You have to pay for the dark mode? Really? It doesn't mattee how helpful this app could be for my life if it damages my eyes a lot more just because I can't afford to go premium and buy the amazing ""dark mode"". At least those whole 2 seconds of interacting with the app were fun."
Limited Habits
It's says Error when copying data when I tried to export data. Can you please mail me the solution again Please
Absolutely hated it it was just weird
Its not working properly
Too expensive.
Not advisable to anyone.
App has too many error to count.
Dark mode in premium
Can not shut off notifications. They keep turning back on.
You can only add 7 habit for free version.
Update killed it a few months ago. The notes were all wrongly ordered. Pointed out the issues to the developer 1.5 months ago but no fix till date. Giving up on this app.
Cool idea but I never got any of the notifications which is kinda the whole point
Cant see all habbits report in one screen. When by mistake you delete a habbit never can see again any where your previous data
You need to pay its not really free
No habits library
I don't get this app
Now a days almost all app give you dark mode out of cost. But this app gives us as a premium feature. Can't edit the start date either. Needed to delete and start again
can't really use it without the ability to create your own categories
I wanna like it but... I need it to allow me to set my routine to repeat every day without having to rewrite my routine for every day. Or am I missing something?
Sahi h
Notification and alarm will automatically turn on even if i have turned off before
"Enjoying this app in general, but notifications don't appear at the set time, and instead just pop up randomly during the day. I've now unchecked the ""remind me to use the app"" setting and hopefully the erratic notifications will stop. But otherwise it's quite good."
Limited habit data
Great so far. I only wish I could set up one task for more than 1 day. It's kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily. If I could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing. Also making it so I can choose a time range would also be really helpful. Some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now I can only choose a time for a reminder. It'll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these. Thanks!
It igood
Why I does not able to add task on a specifically day of every week
It would be 5 stars if could sinc it with other device.
Nice one but I can't amend schedule days after habit saved.
not worth it if you can't go pro
Ok so it's not bad but for me it was a little bit hard to work. But don't get me wrong there are probably loads of people that do understand it. It was just a little hard for me. :)
"Very good job. A ""postpone"" option is needed. It's a priority I believe Also, would like option for completed habits to hide for the day, and option to edit categories names, icons and colours"
I love it so far but is there a way to track ur stats over time?
Very disappointed that you have a very limited amount of habits and you require premium to be removed. I feel it should be lifted!
Le mode alarme ne fonctionne pas bien
Could you please add sub tasks and checklist? And also to add new category?
I haven't found the way to edit the days of the week for one habit.
Theek hai
I dont like u use numbers instead of yes or no but it doesnt show any difference on the calendar eg color difference.
Great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points
You can have just 5 habits for free. We should have more
"I like this app and I bought Premium, even it was a little expensive (5,49 Euro). What I don't like is: Habits ""with a numeric value"" don't allow ""at least 0 times a day"". If you want to do something 6 times a week, with the possibility to do it twice on one day, it will stay undone the other days (-1 *). Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits! After a removal of any named defect I will change my rating."
I like this app. It's simple and gets the job done. Only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version.
"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome."
I can't arrange my habits in the order I want. I have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical.
I did like the app..after I'm reinstalling the app..what happens to my In app purchase..I had purchased the app..Rt now which I'm using is it the paid one or free one. Do I need to pay for premium again??
It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row. Switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything. You have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like.
I have enough credit but I can't purchase for premium
I don't get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so I am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app
Unfortunately the free version does not provide enough functionality for me. I am trying to track habits but it stopped me at 7.
"Two requests please: 1) Allow the user to set what time the day/recurrent tasks reset. Not everyone's ""day"" ends at midnight! 2) Propagate the theme selected to the widget. If I have selected a dark blue theme, my widget should have the same dark blue icon(s), not a bright red HabitNow one. Good so far, more customization would make it great...thanks!"
Can't set times for when tasks need to be completed. Can't tick off tasks for the next day
Dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app. Otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive.
I would give 5 stars if it had the feature to rearrange the items with your specific order instead or being predetermined
Its a good app but i think thers some glitch i cant have more than 6 tasks when i create one it just dosen't show.
lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order. habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them. if you do fix it i will purchase this app
"For $4.99 to $9.99, I'd like more widgets and customization. As it stands, the main widget, ""List"", is block white."
Please give Google login option. So I can backup my data easily.
This app is really nice and makes me to build good habits but only thing is annoying in this app is you can't import more than 7 habits until you get premium.
I like it for now but even after buying the premium version there are a limited number of categories. I have 3 businesses & thus the single briefcase icon doesn't work for me. I would like to be able have a different category icon for each of my various tasks & a larger range of icon options of categories available. There isn't even an icon for pets ! That is super important !
Best hai ji
It's pretty good! User friendly app. Developer gotta work or widget improvements though. Other that than It gets the job done.
Very nice app! How likely is is that you will implement achievements e.g. for streaks?
Nice app
Good App! ❗BUT❗ Need more features for premium users 4 sure.
Very helpfull i use it often to track my studies and to make sure i take out and put in my retainer. When i start getting a paycheck i plan on buying the full version.
Those having trouble after closing app n not geting reminders and alarms the ans is go to ur mob settings and add Habit now app to wont's sleep
"Its an amazing app. Can recurring habits have something like ""every 2nd monday of the month""? Also, how can I finish a habit 2x in the same day?"
Its very helpful
"It's pretty good but for me it's missing one feature. Most of my habits are to be done a certain number of times per week so it would be great to have a week view where you can see the ticks and crosses for each habit so far that week, for all habits at the same time (I know you can see them one at a time by clicking ""last 7 days"" but clicking on this for one habit closes this view for another). Then you can get a good overview of how much you have left to do that week."
Wow bt one thing make me pain . That is money
It's awesome
Great app. Very stable so far.
Good so far
Nice app!
So far so good.
I wish if I can mentor my progress in habits by points not only by days
Thank you
Nice app
Nice
Love to use
Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed. Was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to HabitNow ❣️ Some other useful features: - Add a length to a task or habit - Be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!
Easy to use
Ufff me ayuda demasiado xq soy de las personas q se olvidan las cosas y esta app es la unica q encontre q tenia alarma
Its good i wish i had different lists and could personalize the sound my alarms made each tine they went off
Dashboard/ charts better be inclusive all habits. Not just per one habit. Also download to excel would be nice
Does exactly what it says. Would be 5 stars if the Categories could be customised.
Wish I could add more habits
Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.
"Hi, I would've given this app 5/5 if I hadn't already spent so much time exploring it. It's so cumbersome as it is to check what I have scheduled for a day in the future. I have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a ""month-view- interface. Please make it more intuitive, let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the past/future. Let me also edit tasks/habits from a day in the future."
I wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit I want in any order I want. It lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way I need it. Also wish the conpleted habit or task would disaapear after I complete each day. It either stays where it is or goes to bottom. Other than these I like it.
Great app with an ugly widget. If the widget was cleaner I'd give 5 stars.
Not bad if you want to install
Love this
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
Easy to use and the alarm works great
Addition of day counter for negative habits will be great. Also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful. And widget isn't working.
I love it! Only problem I found is that you can't edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance.
Good
"Everything is good, I bought the premium after 5 minutes used! But one question, why we can't create a task with a date which is the day before??? (eg; Today is 11 May. I can't create a task on date 10 May. Sometimes we might be overlooked or too busy to add task, but we need to have a record of what we had done on the day, it can make us feel so ""completed"")"
Please create desktop app
Good
I really love the setup of this app. I wish it had the ability to see weekly progress in a bullet journal style. That would make it perfect for me.
Easy and practical !
Easy to use. Great for creating new routines and habits
Like the app. Either I haven't found it or they don't have it in the free app but I would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day. Would be fun to see at the end of the month all that I did on one calendar.
Nice app. Quick question can I add new categories when adding my habits? I'm not see an option. Only the options that came with the app is available. Is it that everything else must go under other? Please advise
The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for
This is a very good app... just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice.
Why there's no option to change schedule?
Preaty nice but they could improuve the UI it took me some time to figure it out. And I know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app
Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.
Works Great
"Funciona bien, pero si le hacen falta cosas, tengo la versión premium, resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías (donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría) por ejemplo: como sabemos, existe categoría denominada ""study"" pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí. Sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se HACE."
I like using the app and my weekly progress. I would like to see a total of how many things I did each day and maybe a graph? I like positive reinforcement.
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.
Great at 1st
Alarm not working at all. I have checked all settings in my phone they all are on. Could you please assist me on same.
"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits."
Great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it. Have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency.
não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa
I haven't started using it officially but I'm giving a 4 star because the User Interface is on point... I'm starting my habits on monday... Hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the UI. Thank you
"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think."
Great app! How can I change the alarm sound
awesome app .. i like the daily work and habit tracking .. thanks guys
Helped me a lot
I liked it I just have to many things I want to put in it and I can't afford to pay for premium.
I like it. It's quite easy to use. Would it be possible to sync data between devices? That would be a lovely plus!
I liked it but once I got it I saw a had no need for it and I felt like I don't need it as much as others.
Simple and practical
Easy to add habits and tasks; you see everything for that dat
it s great
Set a color which depends on percentage for goals.
good enough👍👍👍
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am."""
Good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress
Good
Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!
Please add an option to update habit/task status from the notification bar when I receive notification on the set time. Overall good app.
It is a good for organising daily task n making habit
"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect."
Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.
Handy habit helper
Good app. Wish there were more customization
I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.
great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks
Very useful! Reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done. Would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version Thank you!
This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.
this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.
So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday)
quite a good app for me
I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice
this helped to fix my life
It's good.when I install it.I have many plans every day. Thanks for your program.🌹🌹🌹
A really nice and amazing app. Lots of flexibility even in the free version. Love it so far.
Very nice app I downloaded many app but it is the best app I love this app thanks for this app 👍😄👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 I love this app
Actually we need two type of tools one for long term growth 'Good Habits' and short term ' to do list' this aap fullfil both the purpose
Nice app. I Love it
I love this app so much. 5 starts definitely. I just got the app and I love it. But there is only one thing I really want a different background on the app. But for that I need premium I don't think that's fare. But 5 stars love it!
I love this App. This app is just right for me.
Perfect for my needs of tracking goals
Absolutely love this app it is so simple to use and it will remind you of everything ! I would recommend this app to anyone
great app
Helps to create new habit love it
Litt it helps a lot
Easy to use and organize yourself. I love the habit feature to help you train yourself into healthy habits.
Best app keep it up 👍👍
"This is the app that i kept from numerous time management apps. All are full of features but not practical. This app serves me clear cut. Habit & Task, simple and most practical 😍 But I can't set the ""ending"" reminder alarms for a habit, i can only start but we need a alarm that tell us to stop 😒"
Super useful and easy to sort out.
An awesome app! I strongly recommend you to install it and use! It has banch of advantages including pin!
Terrific for reminders and tracking. Enjoying this app.
Best app
This app really helped me organize my life!
life changing app
Excellent interface. Easy to use.
Best
This is the best app I am being used I will never change it I started to use 1 year ago and I did not complain of anything
Great app for making new Habits
I did not get any app like this 😃
I was not able to change the am and pm settings. It is really helpful app try it.. thank you very much
So good app
Great app! Instantly bought premium! Would it be possible to scale the widget (or make a new one) that's fits a small 1x1 size? I replaced my previous habit tracker with this app and I really miss that feature! I'm sure it will help others too! Keep up the good work!
I struggle with starting any new habits. This was instrumental in even beginning a new habit. Super easy to set up. I get reminders. There's nightly accountability to check off the daily habits. I purchased the premium as I decided I wanted more than 7 new habits!
Excellent... Lovely and really helpfull! Thanks!
It is an amazing app and very easy to use it sends me notifications so I can keep my progress every single time I look at the app it motivates me to complete all tasks and habits Trust me you will love ticking those boxes after a task is done amazing satisfaction definitely would recommend
Love it. Customizable so you can track progress or just be reminded to do something.
Good
Perfect for establishing a daily routine!
I adore this app
Pleaseee add more categories like hobbies and self development
My favorite part: I can leave memos for any day on any habit. Incredibly useful addition!
This amazing app has really helped me get myself onto the right path. Thank you to the entire team.
It is an incredible app 🐱
I wish I found this app sooner ... I am in love with it . It very practical and it user friendly thank you !!
Great app for accountability and enforcing habits
very nice app for habit reminder u
Simple and easy to use!
Easy to use and a nice clean interface. I like the notification options and the data reports that you can see I'd give it 6 stars if I could
Luis《《《《☆☆☆
Giving 5 star becoz its ad free
"Very easy app to use. I also use a hardcopy calendar. This app saves me from having to transfer tasks to next day automatically until completed. I would love to view just the tasks or just the habits in addition to current view. I just got this app & liked it so much that I bought it. It helps me ""chunk down"" my tasks so they don't overwhelm me. Also loves that it includes habits. A nice combo. I love the way it looks. Great job!"
Everybody need this app
Love it... It is so helpful... Everything I thought it would be and more 😃
this is a good app for me i love thousandage this app help all day energic
Increíble app!!
It's good apps. You can manage yourself
It will better to give 10 stars amazing app . Thank tou habit now
pretty good
Great tool! Easy to setup
It is the best app guys don't think just go for it....😘
it is wonderful apps amazing!
This is the best habit app I have used so far and I've tried out several!
This app is the best app I ever seen. Super. I appreciate whoever created this app
Keeps me on track
Great app
Wonderful App to monitor daily routine for improvement (forced as well as manual) Request to author 1. Please add option to add reminder on specific date of every month ( monthly repeating task on specific date) 2. Biometric login 3. UI could be more better 4 add tab for notes keeping (no reminder) 5 add tab for list (no reminder) 6 option to sync Google Calendar
Works great for my routines
Wonderful app to generate good habits and complete the task.
Best habit app
Awesome
Its super helpful.
I am very much satisfied with this app. Well structured. Will like to use this app life long. Option for recurring task (unfinished task) seems awesome
that's what I was looking for 🥰
Enjoy the app!
Best app
I like using the app. But I'm not able to see previous month bar graphs. Is it happening only for me?
Nice p
Well organised and... 💾😊and loving it....
I love it! Palling of going pro!
"Great app. 5 stars for sure. What would make it even better from my POV: /- An option to set recurring tasks. e.g I want to pay my bills every month on the 1st, and I want to add a single recurring task. New Habit has the option ""How often do you want to do it"", but New Task does not. /- An ""are you sure"" question before deleting or undo option after. /- The option to filter the list of tasks by category. Especially if you also use it for work tasks, like I do"
Does exactly what it should do. Gives you zero BS. Helped me create purpose and structure during quarantine so that I don't go crazy.
"I'm really enjoying this app, but I wish it had the following: more view, color, and size options, analytics on all habits done in the course of a week or month, and better widgets. The text is so small in the widget and the texts for the habits in the app doesn't stand out. Oh and setting rewards for completing habits would be really cool. A ""Rewards Earned"" section that you check off once you use the reward (like buy yourself an ice cream)."
I REGULARLY USED THIS APP N IT HELP ME TO TRACK MY HABBIT N ENCOURAGE ME TO BE BETTER N BETTER TASK IS ALWAYS CHALLANGE FOR ME N WITH THE HELP OF THIS APP I COMPLETE MY TASK WITHOUT FORGOTTEN OR TAKE IT SERIOUSLY SO IT CHANGE MY LIFE N SOMEWHAT MY LIFE IS REGULAR WITH THIS APP. THANKS HABITNOW
Do we have this app for ios ?
Great app helped me with my routine and reminders. Thank you
Really useful app..
Very Nice Interface. We can track our to dos for the day and Habits that we want to develop. Fair pricing. Less in size so even simple phones can have.
Best way to organize habits .suggest you to download the app!!!😘
It's ambitious
Already loved the app.. today i installed and fall in love with it
I love this app this is used to track our good and bad habits also we can check our track record for previous month or week.
Easy and good to use Very helpful to analyse the habit in detail with statistics which has made this app so useful to everyone
Very useful app ever i have seen
nice
This is a great partner for daily activities....
Love it. Easy to use. Can customize to whatever you want and set the reminder according to when you want it.
The best. I paid for the premium too
I have enjoyed this app so much. I need to add more habits to it because it really works!
Amazing app Helps you design your life and your day to day activities Do check it out.!
Best app
Verry helpfull😍😍
Buy it
Awesome app for habit and task tracking. It also has a fair pricing.
شكرا جزيلا لكم
This app is very useful for students so try it....
I love the flexibility and customization of this app. It is also very reliable!
The app is super legit ;) Please make possible to decide the order in which the comments appear under the calendar in the habits section. I have a comment of 8/4/20 followed by a comment of 7/5/20 followed by 8/5/20. Is impossible to have comments organized chronologically. Thanks for the amazing app :D
It is so good app I like it so much
Seems pretty good so far.
A very good app ... It helps me to manage my online classes and daily routine together... 😄😄😄😄
Really cool app.
Amazing app....it's very helpful for me
It is great....
This is wonderful and it's only $5 (one time) to get the premium version.
I love having a fully customizable checklist widget.
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.
I love it for this aap
It is easy to follow and I love the reminders! It is super helpful for me!
Chill and easy. Good for keeping track of my habits
This app is very simple and easy 👍. My favorite quality that the app is offering it's users is the one time buy premium that's only 5 bucks!(finally not a monthly one so I can actually buy it) anyway love the app and I like my high importance tasks that I have to finish today... The importance level... Anyway see ya 🙃
extremely helpful and easy to use
I'm so happy with this app
It worked perfectly for me and benefits me with fantastic pleasures!!
I've never rated something on Google Play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something. This is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way. It allows you to view the progress you're making with habits. And it gives you the most functionality without having to pay anything. Other apps give little functionality before you have to pay.
Love it! The app I have been looking for
Loved it.. easy tracking.. detailed statistics.. Thank you for this ..
Premium version is awesome. Must use app to develop self discipline and to track your activities. Good stats window and satisfying UI.
Super duper amazing app .... Exactly what i wanted
Exactly what I was looking for. This app really helps me keep track of my habits and it super user friendly. Love it!
So nice daily routine app
Very Good App..😊👍
Good app but its not notifying me in my new phone LG but my old phone it does ring can someone tell me how to fix this problem ? The habitNow team helped me fix the problem it was the feature of battery optimizer on my phone thank you great app!
I love this app because it's really useful for planning
Love it. The answer of my hope. Thank you HabitNow 🤍
It is a very fantastic app and it reminds me to do studies and do my homework...
Cool
Nice application it was really very useful I did my work on time I was so much free time so that's good news I love it I'llI give u guys 5 🌟 stars. I want another to do app it must have talking alarm and please reply me THANKS FOR THE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY NICE APP bye
Супер
It is a practical app and easy to use.
Best habit app to date! Has every feature were other apps only have limited features. The only habit app you'll ever need.
It works
Great option but you must divide your habits in sub-habits to really achieve them. Thanks to developer team. Its a great app.
Very easy to use 😄😃
Everything I needed in one App.
It is a really useful app
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates
Simple to use
Peter Pan first born creator of existence
Nice app for daily activities...
Very good😛👍
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍
It enurages me to hat want to do in order to develop good healthy habits.
Requires an MS account.
No calendar view
Doesnt work with non microsoft email address.
Very worst as compared to Google calendar. I think Google calendar and your this apps to be put it in the litter bins.
"i miss wunderlist with comment. and now to do deleted comment function, and now be ""silent"" apps ..."
What more can I say had to change my password cause I forgot and it asks me to change my password again due to questionable activity. Don't want to deal with it anymore its just a darn list who gives a rats behind if someone wants to b view what I'm picking up for dinner they can pick it up for me if they want but not trying to come up with a whole new password so you can make me create another one 10 minutes later.
I can't synchronize my to do list with my devices
I have to log-in/sign-up to use it... I dont want to make any kind of account.
I can't use my old email on my laptop and use a current email on the laptop. The app will not let me use my current email and password.
In the last update the auto update for lists across multiple devices stopped working.
Dud
Garbage! Takes a simple concept and turns in to a spam generator.
Didn't have a good experience sorry
Stupid app keeps kicking me out of my account.
No notification. When I will the app then it will remind me
It's just opening pages forever out lighting images why!
Not syncing properly with Office online
Worked good but then it just kicked me out of the app
Worst.
It is not giving me a reminder as a notification on my notification bar it is also not giving me any notification in the form of sound or vibration
1 star for not letting me to try the app without signing in.
"Decided to STOP using it. As I have to add lists MANUALLY to ""My Day"" page. Every planned tasks doesn't AUTOMATICALLY listed on my day page. Every other apps doesn't need to do that time wasting thing of manually adding the lists."
Can't print after last update
Does not work nice interface but faulty doesn't work
Sync don't work. Can't invite directly and ... Every programmer in this world can do better than this. Wunderlist was a great app I'm very sorry for what happened to it
Login taking so much time
Garbage
No dark mode for widget
Not ready for prime time
"Would have given this app 5 stars but for 3 issues. 1. The ""Notes"" icon keeps appearing next to reminders. 2. The tasks do not appear in order of time, but alphabetically. This is really annoying. 3. The tasks do not appear on the calender, which is also really annoying."
"The daily reminder for any task only works if the task is tapped ""completed"" either through notification (completed/snooze) or through App even if the task is actually not completed . If you swipe the notification without tapping on ""completed"", the daily reminder stops. This is funny. The ""daily reminder"" should continue daily whether the task for a particular day is completed or not completed."
"I hate that ""Note"" symbol showing up on tasks even I didn't put any notes and that makes me go crazy because I have to open each and every task to see that I have put notes. It worked fine when I downloaded it. Please fix it. It really annoying."
"Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an ""assigned to me"" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."
"All tasks now appear with a ""note"" icon, even if there is no note there. Completely unreliable with the reminders of repeated tasks: -Sometimes the ""remind me at"" goes blank for no apparent reason. -Check the task after midnight of its due date and you won't get reminded of this task the next day -The app either forgets ""remind me"" or ""repeat"" part after one cycle of task done)."
Why suggest tomorrow option in widget
I can't create an account
Pants
Notes sign is in ALL notes. All over the internet. YET. Microsoft NOT fixing. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO FIX THE BUG? IT HAS BEEN A MONTH THAT WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING THIS.
Terrible I'm sure I'm not the only one saying this but I'll add mine. It used to be a great app as wunderlist but is now terrible. I can only assume its intentional to force people elsewhere because there's some money to be made. An added recent quirk is it doubling any hylerlink in the notes whenever you close the keyboard ( a more insane quirk i couldn't dream up). Don't bother.
Update made it so that every entry has a note attached and doesn't have the ability to actually edit the note on android. Doesn't happen on the PC version of the app.
Multiple bugs in the Andriod and windows versions. No one responds to the Uservoice and Helpshift bug posts. Seems like Microsoft has not invested properly in the Dev team
Forced on us as wonderlist was stolen
"Would be 5 Stars but does not have option for recurrence. Due dates for more than ""today"" is not working. There is no shame also in adding nice and convenient Calendar options from Outlook or Microsoft's other software options"
Not so good
I miss wunderlist. It was much better.
Very bad
Anybody who selected 5 starts CLEARLY did not EVER use Wunderlist. But it is IMPOSSIBLE not to make the comparison consideration for a review. This company plays foul. You buy out an excellent competitor for this app you are pushing and then rather than improve on it you produce something unquestionably inferior. Dastardly deed and regardless of your improvements there are others out there I'll choose. You won't get my support full stop. 1. I can't add a task and have it emailed to the team member. They have to keep checking ToDo all during the day wasting time. 2. We lost the crucial COMMENTS section. This allowed a team member to provide a status update or send a query. This had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task. It allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback. Now we have to go to a different app like email or whatsapp to respond. 3. Can't sort the tasks according to TEAM MEMBER. So I gotta scroll and scroll to find all tasks I gotta talk to a team member about. There's more but out of words
Sign up and login does not work
The stopped working the next day i downloaded it and got signed out and when i tried signing in...it said problem with my account duh
Crashes suddenly
Good
Bring back Wunderlist you cowardly knaves
"Edit: originally 3/5 because it is a nice app with one major flaw. Microsoft commented on my original review saying to contact customer service via email I did and they told me to look at one setting but my phone doesn't have that setting. They responded back basically ""o well. That's all we got"" and said it's my phone's fault. Like really? Piss poor support. Especially considering the app works fine for an extended period but then will stop. Can't be the setting they recommended."
If I edit something in the note then pressed back button it will save without confirmation dialog & will lost those words if it happened by accident!
It was a huge thing I lost my data along with my account
Why do i need an account for do to list
Bring back wunderlist Inconsistencies with being able to assign users to list. Some lists not identifying users who have already been added and are active on the list.
Terrible.
undo option not in app and bin. By mistake delete task folder And it is not recovered now☹️
Keeps blocking me every time change password.very frustrating
Why am I only allowed to be signed into one device at a time and need to go through the process of signing in every single time I try to check it or add something on another device?
I've been trying to get start the app but it is not working at all....popping the same temporary problem on screen....is it really a helpful app?
Doesn't have comments as wunderlist does
What the hell wrong with you!😡how many will you take recover the account?Go to hell!you clumsy!
I still feel this app has ruined Wunderlist after using Wunderlist for so many years and this Todo has so many bugs.
Why Do I have to sign In again even tho I did not even log out in the first place It is very Inconvenient for a to do list
Appalling product
So boring .
I miss wunderlist's aggregated notifications
You have to create a Microsoft account to use the app.
To hard to sign-in. Make it easier to sign in. I wasn't able to sign in or use the app. Uninstalled.
So there are lot of bugs.. If I do not mark reminder as completed then it goes away from the notifications when the date changes.. It's a daily reminder so I don't get notification next day as well untill I open app and mark that reminder as completed
Standard above average
The app is easy to use and is very effective. I never experienced any technical failure or downtime.
Registration is required
WHY ISN'T MONDAY THE START OF THE WEEK?
It wors fine on my phone but its terrible on my desktop not all my sub information on a tab is showing this is the United States you should not be able to put a product out if it doesn't work properly you think because we're not paying for these apps you can just put anything out .
Long time fan and user of wunderlist. Switched to do last year before the app was fully shut down. And been mostly happy until last week when To Do started deleting tasks.
Terrible experience with this. My lists transferred from Wunderlist (which never caused me any problems) and now To Do keeps losing my lists so I have to reinstall all the time. Sort it out or I'm using another app
Garbage. Find something else if you need to share lists with someone else.
Tasks that i want them to be daily should appear on my day Spontaneously I'm tired of adding them every time
Can't get it to make a sound when some one adds a something
Doesn't work in miui 12
Не приходят уведомления! Несколько устройств на разных платформах - одна и та же проблема. Сервис просто не работает!
Very bad app what i think but this app is wrost
Whatever I do I won't get reminders set by me on this app. I migrated from wanderlist. The import of the data was very smooth but not able to use the basic feature of reminders & notification on my Android phone.
Won't sync with my computer despite repeated attempts. I miss Wunderlist
"Why am I being logged out of the application after every one day? It is so annoying now. Even when putting the right the password, message pops up saying ""Something wrong with the Microsoft account"", any explanation? It is so sad to see a company like Microsoft can't provide a well functional service! Disappointed."
Not sure why this is not available to an individual's office account. We pad it just the business or school account did.
нет авторизации через google
Reminder and snooze notification arrives only when I unlock the phone. Useless
Logs me out without notice
Works only with a Microsoft account.
Why am I not getting any notification? None at all! I even checked the notification settings.
You have to use an account.
cannot use without logging in to microsoft account
You should Add time parameter also. Means if I pointed out important work of day but in important work what time I should assign and when to do should also be visible below that work not in the form of symbol but in the form of time and data get arranged according to time.
I got this because you cant set voice reminders in cortana anymore. But you cant set them in this app either. Confusing layout and doesn't have the functionality of a personal. assistant. Trash.
Doesn't sync with my wife. Essentially as useful as notepad. Wanderlist was a significantly better app.
Useless since I can't put exact time for a deadline
Needs a lot of improvement. Suggestion or feedback shared is waste as no one replies.
Useless
I'm not able to login since last 3 months. Highly unsatisfied
Microsoft killed a great app (Wunderlist) by taking out the core functionality of integrating it with calendars
"""your favorite features are all in To Do"" - blatant lie, To Do doesn't have email notifications like Wunderlist, for example. upd 18/05/20 - and now reminders left (accidentally or intended) overnight are simply disappearing, in the morning you won't see any To Do reminders! I'm really disappointed! upd 19.08.20 - still without any improvements, no email notifications and disappearing notifications after 00:00, I wish I could rate ZERO star"
Bring back Cortana!
"This app is fantastic! Except...I cannot manually rearrange my ""Important"" list. When that is updated, I will come back to leave a 5 star review. Until then, the app will always be lacking."
"How do i only see tasks due for today i see that the ""my day"" tab has an option to add the days tasks is there a way to make this automatic? Sick of seeing tasks that are not for today but the next day or even weeks in the future just piled together also i have daily repeating tasks that when i complete todays task it gets replaced with tommorrows which makes it really hard to know if i've done todays when they look the exact same except for a tiny ""tommorrow"" at the bottom of the button helpp"
Shouldn't need to login
Aak
not able to login..say not login with personal account..I have only one microsoft account
You have to pay and install another app (outlook) on another machine (windows only PC) to be able to undelete a list.. Mistakes will be punished!
Wunderlist was so much better. I can't find a way to delete the my day and tasks feature. I just want lists.
Why do you have to sign in at microsoft account
"There's a simple app on playstore named ""To do list"" and it does what it says. Yours, my god.. It is so terrible. It can't even do a simple task. For eg: few tasks that i have set on repeat doesn't even show automatically in the ""My day"" tab. I mean why not."
Many problems with this app..
Need an undo button!
i can't use it for a month because email was wrong. that's insane
I dont understand the idea of an account. Just give me an offline program
Reminders DON'T work.
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.
It doesn't run on oneplus 7t Pro
"Seems alright so far but since there's not a single setting for notifications, easy 1 star. Some lists I'm part of, i don't want or need notifications every single time something is added. Add notification settings for a higher rating. Something that shouldn't even need to be asked for. Not fixed still, plus widget doesn't update with restart. Stays blank on ""my day"" can't open it"
I miss wonder list. To Do sucks. It is impossible to get anything entered without wanting to throwmy phone across the room. Dear Microsoft screw yourself.
I dont wanna log in with stupid micro acc
It's not Wunderlist. Took a good app and ruined it. Just opened it up (July 2020) no sync. Try later. Huh? Microsoft garbage?
Need be online every time start
Terrible
Too bad app not working since the day i started using... The apps again and again saying some prob occurred please check 8n browser.....
Not good
Sign in not working
requires microsoft account. deal breaker.
Totally useless - sharing lists does not work.
I installed it in m laptop and it can't even launch.. The program continues to crash
I very beginning I can easily add by tasks list i.e shopping list to home screen of my mobile but know this is not working please fix the issue
It doesn't gives a reminder of of my tasks and planned items at all
Sadly Microsoft have a history of replacing perfectly efficient apps with less efficient ones. They have purchased and killed off the immensely popularWunderlist no doubt hoping they could transfer it's users to their vastly inferior product. I have just give it a third try out but Todo is still a 2nd rate'camel' of an implementation. I have been using remember the milk which is fairly excellent but will move to Aoya which may suit me better.
Does job
There's no option to export my task list if I want to migrate to another app. Or just dump my task data into a CSV. I'm out of todo to avoid getting locked in. Google is less evil that way. I can move out of its ecosystem any time I want and export all my data.
I had to switch from Wunderlist and one of the most important features no longer exists..the ability to duplicate a list. I have a couple long lists with sub tasks that needs to be replicated on a regular basis so this is a deal breaker for me.
TRUE AMOLED DARK MODE is needed (amoled/fully black pixels off) not DARK GRAY.
Since a few weeks there's a bug that adds a blank note to every item you add. Highly annoying as this makes actual notes no longer stand out. Was 5 stars before that bug though.
Struggling with a new feature that suddenly appeared where if I post a task it comes with a sticker. How do I remove this?
Widget not displaying todos properly!!!!
Home screen widget doesn't load when the phone starts.
Loved it originally but can't stand the little page icons that clutter my lists now.
Need improve 1. Add the option to Use Gmail for flagged task 2. Incorporate a pomodoro option to do the tasks 3. Improve the widget appearance
Efficient!
I need to manage blocks of time to schedule it
"Migrated from Wunderlist because I had to and a feature I absolutely want and don't have is notifications of new tasks or completed tasks. Microsoft makes this feature available for ""Personal"" accounts but not a team, corporate one. How stupid is that??? Microsoft assumes work tasks don't require notifications too??"
"This app only notifies me of one reminder at a time, so if I don't clear the notification, it stops notifying me of other reminders. It also doesn't allow scheduling more than 1 reminder for a task on a given day. ""Repeat"" doesn't help. You can't duplicate a task to make a 2nd reminder either, I have to make another task and manually copy and paste the name, notes, and date. Notification syncing is broken for me too, I have to clear every reminder on both my computer and phone every time."
Assigning tasks to multiple users is missing which is very much needed. Wunder list looks much easy to work than this.
Whenever I sign it always show something went wrong plz sign in again this same problem occurs in other Microsoft app also with me
I just went into my app and somehow everything was lost! I had to import everything again from Wunderlist but it was the old lists so I lost some REALLY IMPORTANT INFO and I'm pissed.
After the last update I can no longer get notification automatically. I get notification only when I open the app. Please help resolve it. It is a great app.
Sick and tired of suggestions being made by many of us in the forums and being ignored by you devs. Will use another app instead.
Asking for sign in frequently
I need dupplicate task function
Hate having to sign in Microsoft to use MY TO DO LIST. It was great when it was Wunderlist.
Because I though that the teams are related to this app. I downloaded but I was wrong
"Still handles only the most basic task repeat functions. Cannot handle ""the second Sunday every X months"" or ""last day of the month"" scanarios. Interface is only so-so, does not show task times at a glance in main Tasks screen"
The flagged email list has items in it that I ha e not flagged and also are not in my email account. I guess your software has been hacked or has a problem. All the emails are what I would call spam. Unwanted.
Reminders don't popup so I keep forgetting to do things. Unless your at a PC (where I see outlook reminders anyway) it's pretty useless
Crappy microsoft log in. No matter what I did I could not log in. I ended up downloading an older apk outside playstore with an older form of log in. I successfully logged in with the old version and then updated the app through playStore. The only reason I give 2 stars instead of 1 is that the app is great in every other way.
Sk aftar
Why can I snooze only up to an hour???? Where is a 4-hour snooze option? And 1-day option?? I also can't sort tasks by reminder date. Most of my tasks don't have a due date but they have a reminder date. I need to be able to sort by the remainder date!
Nothing more than a simple to do list without any decent widgets. Nobody wants to open the app every time they want to create a new task or check something they already did
I miss the integration with Cortana. Used to be able to talk while driving to add a task. This requires too much hand interaction. Even simple apps like shopping list on android allow voice input.
Please add today's task to my day automatically. Now it has to do it manually. Can you add calendar events in to do .
"I kinda like it, but I miss a lot of options. Few suggestions : more options on repeating task e.g. repeat every last friday, add an alert for the person task is assigned to, show tasks that has due date of today in ""My day"", have an option to let person the task is assigned to edit the task and option to choose your week start."
Prefer wunderlist! This is a sad adaptation and should have never replaced an app that worked so well.
Look so simple but not. Its really confused to do i ever use. How can i focused when i finised 1 thing for my daily routine and still there with schedule for different day.
Notification improper or null
It looks great but will not allow importing via a Google software/ platform.. it works only for Wunderlist. 🥺. Why? Wish we could use it.
Daily reminder doesn't work perfectly.
Why this so doesn't remind me?
This app has a great ui and ux but there's one thing that really makes it useless. I'd doesn't sync in the background so I add a tskl via desktop it'll probably not show on my phone unless i open the app on my phone. It makes the app risky if you need to count on your reminders. Another problem is the time suggestion when you create a task is always behind the keyboard and it's hard to use it like that/
It mixes todays completed task by Tomorrow. Which is really bad experience and gives no happiness after completing a task. Todays completion must be removed and tomorrows list must be visible by tomorrow. Not today. Fix it.
You'd thing MS can come up with something better. Very basic. You can't view tasks in your calendar. You can specify task start and end time. Recurring tasks sometimes don't respawn properly.
Can't Sync I am unable to sync my phone account to PC account
Doesn't respect silent mode.
Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there
MS has screwed up wunderlist the same as to skype.... So clunky and average poorly thought out; should have just changed wunderlists logo and colour scheme. The desktop version is slow (10s) to respond. You can be doing changes on the desktop and it get jammed up with app.
App is great for the people who forget their tasks. I will be grateful if the company adds alarm reminders in this app.
Not easy to use. And doesn't do a good job of keeping reminders
I guess once you get the instructions you realize that a calendar app preinstalled is more effective.
Como que eu configuro uma tarefa para ser realizada todas as terças e quartas? Se não é possível fazer isso adicionando apenas uma tarefa precisa melhorar urgentemente
Missing features from Wunderlist. Might need to find a new app.
Wont sync w my crew. I have to cut and paste lists. Wunderlist was seemless
"Widget is horrible. Keeps switching to ""my day"" and won't allow me to change it. Really expected better from Microsoft."
Sync between PC and Android app is very slow! Wunderlist was better. Moving to Google Tasks now. Microsoft ruined a good thing.
The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.
Difficult login forces work or school address. Lost Wunderlist lists as a result
Wunderlist was better
Does not store none tasks information well.
Great app but will have to uninstall if they don't sync with google calendar or include a calendar!
"Widget misbehaves, it keeps switching to ""My day"" and stops reacting to any taps when it does"
Thanks for ruining Wunderlist you jackasses
Romantic
Can't sort via categories. Importance level doesn't sync well. Basically syncing problems all around. Creating new lists don't show in Outlook proper.
Doesn't auto add to My Day schedule wise. Repeat reminder doesn't work either.
Missing the widget for iOS A to-do/reminder app is incomplete without a widget. Otherwise 5 stars.
Just like wunderlist except worse !! Laggy update of list from one device to any.
Doesn't sync well with my laptop
Desktop widget stops functioning every minute!!
Widget continues to stop working nothing shows up until I resize it.
This is by far the best To-Do app. I gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use Microsoft Account for sharing the lists.
Completely broken for synch. Wunderlist actually worked. This is a disaster.
"Doesn't allow you to sort completed tasks. I have a single grocery list with 300 tasks in it's completed section that's named by section using tags like ""Produce - onions"". I used to be able to sort completed tasks alphabetically making it easy to have a running list where I could add back frequently purchased items. Now everything is lost automatically placed in completed tasks by completion chronology. Is a pain."
Forced to review to avoid popups every few days. Ok so far
Why widget is not working....???!!!!!
Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password
I m facing the i same issue which kenners79(below comment on 9/6/2020) is facing. Widget issue.
This app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen. They have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists. Might as well just use OneNote now. At lest that is used on my PC too.
UI is good. Easy to use. The only thing that bother me is that the reminder didn't work. That's the basic and important feature of to do app. Missed many task because of this. Please fix it.
App's widget still doesn't react correctly to dark mode changes. I can't see the list often!!
Too complicated
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works."
The invite user feature is horrible. You can only do it through email as the text option doesn't work. I used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app. I was a user of Wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as I can tell.
Can't use without a MS account. Improved sync. Widget doesn't allow you to chose which list you'd like to see without going into the app.
Failed to arrange my tasks by dragging them as used to do with Wunderlist
Why the comments section is not available yet? As I checked most of users needed it. We had it in wunderlist but here it is not possible to put a comment with recorded date in any list task.
Nice integration with Teams & Planner. Would get an extra star if I could assign tasks directly from To Do.
"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help"
I have finally given up with this Application. Although it works ok on its own not being part of Outlook (calendar & mail) on my Andoid phone is a drag. If I put a To Do into my calendar I like to also add it to my to do list but having to run this as a second stand alone app is far from ideal. On my Windows phone it was integrated into Outlook as it is on the PC. Why isn't it part of Outlook?
Another shity microlimp product. They can't even copy a decent app.
Love the app as I am one of the migrated users from Wanderlist but have been a bit disappointed with the following after using To Do: 1. Option to change from Task list to pure check list. 2. Can't install the App on my PC although it is already on my Android phone.
Widgets not working in latest update.
Bring back Wunderlist. My list won't sync with people and I'm having issues.
Widget does not allow you to input to specific lists. Makes for a hassle to open the whole app to add milk to my grocery list.
The notification feature doesn't work for my phone. It's mi note8.
"I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but the app glitches CONSTANTLY with Chrome OS. Whenever I flip to ""My Day,"" the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible. I used it on my Android phone and previously on my Macbook with no problem. I loved the ""My Day"" function and am loathe to switch to a different app, but I don't think I have a choice."
"New update makes ""Planned"" inconvenient. I do like that you can group them now, a much desired thing from wunderlist. But I cant see overdue anymore. Can you please add overdue when viewing ""This Week"". It's inconvenient to flip between categories to see everything on one page."
Where is calender?
A lot worse UX than wunderlist
All of my notifications from a day disappear if I clear one after midnight. What's the point of a to do list that won't allow notifications to persist?
"A new ""feature"" of Microsoft To Do compared to Wunderlist is notifications being cleared at the start of every new day. This is incredibly annoying because if I don't have time to get to it, I want it to be a constant annoying reminder so I know to get around to it. I would rather continue to use Wunderlist, if the recurring tasks was implemented offline, instead of requiring the server to give you a recursive task."
Please add a duedate on sub-step on a task.
Need ability to sort completed tasks.
At first I liked that I could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order. I use this app also as a grocery list. So every time I want to add the done tasks I have to go throw everything. Why can't you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well. Or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves. The way it is now (chaotic) it is very user unfriendly and time consuming.
Migrating from Wunderlist but to be honest with zero integration with google calendar as Wunderlist had...this does not work for me. Off to todoist which has full integration. Really don't understand why you would close Wunderlist before having the same features in ToDo...
"I have down graded my review because ""show completed & hide completed"" features have been removed. Also the ability to edit an item has also disappeared."
REALLY miss Wunderlist. This just feels like a list of work I have to do rather than a list of possibilities from which to choose. To Do is a clunky PC type office app. Wunderlist was a fun life mobile app. I'll be looking for an alternative to To Do.
It was great until the latest release broke most of the useful functionality
Also forced to move from Wunderlist. Im missing the part on my widget where I could see today's tasks but also those for My Week and the overdue tasks as well. Please improve.
Not as good or sleek as wunderlist. I miss wunderlist.
Man!!we cannot have an alarm type alert here...it brings a problem
برنامه خوبیه چون خیالت راحته تو گوشی ذخیره نمیشن. دسته بندیش خوبه ولی نقص داره هنوز. قابلیت بکاپ تو حافظه گوشی نداره. اگه حواست نباشه چیزی پاک کردی قابلیت برگشت نداره. و مقداری نسبت به نسخه کلاسیک مقداری دیر لود میشه.
Reminders sometimes don't work. Especially if set through browser on desktop or if we edit description after setting the reminder.
I really like this app but i dont like microsoft i have gotton locked from this app so many times.
It's not as nice as wunderlist was.
The app is good and useful with great features it has everything that you need for a basic to do list app. but the reason for my 3 stars is that the widget is broken.
"It's extremely limited. There is no natural language processing. Even in English. You can't just type ""buy bread on Monday"" or ""call Max at 9"", which has been a basic features of this class of apps for years. There is only one level of sub-tasks. I wanted to switch to it from Todoist because I'm not a power user and would be happy with a basic app, but it lacks even the basics."
I really can't change notification sound and it uses the same phone notification.
I think that if it was linked to a calender it would be perfect
Back button doesn't shut down application...
Widget doesn't load upon phone restart on samsung S20 FE. It fixes itself once I load the app. Outside of that this is a great app
I hoped it have a timetable something
Great app for managing your activities helped me alot but there is some issues Like The notifications doesn't always shows and reminds me that I have to do the task.
New user
Please add an oled friendly dark colour scheme to the widgets
It's good
It stops working in between times! Sometimes it stops reminding me about my tasks and sometimes it does. Please fix this
Please unify gui and workflow of planner and to do.
It serves the purpose but it's not exactly what I want in the way of organization.
Thank You :)
Good
Please allow me to set due time also instead of just due date
It was working all good until the recent update. I use it on a split screen on a tablet. Previously the left hand side list bar was automatically hidden if the screen is small. Now it always stays which means the task list on the right is impossible to read.
Its very helpful
I like it but it started putting a note icon below each item I add to the list. It makes the item box twice as tall and it's super annoying.
It a decent basic app for what I need. My only current issue is that the height of each task box. Way too much white space on each individual task.
Can it show the schedule into calendar view?
So sad that Wunderlist must gone. Will this one expect the expectation? Why i can't open to do in web browser?!
"Homescreen widget drop-down for ""Day"", ""Task"", etc isn't working 🤒"
There should be a note keeping feature
Sync not happen properly in time . Takimg longer time . (PC and mobile ) and attachtment of picture not showing thumblail preview .
Best
Please make widget more cool.
Shame that when someone is creating a task there is no notification to the person this task is assigned to.
Please fix the Android bug whereby every new item added gets a Note added too - very annoying!!!
Bug: some items without notes show in the list with the note icon underneath. On iOS the same list correctly doesn't show any note icon.
Microsoft has screwed up a really good app.
Why To do auto add the notes in all tasks?
Microsoft can do better🤔🤔
I have two problems: 1)If I am offline and application is closed then on my android 7.0 app do not works 2)I am unable to disable vibration(I do not founded in options menu). Please help
Decent. It would be good to add custom notifications
Previous versions had more fine grained options in the settings. They made the app really useful. I'd like them back.
App is good. Sticky notes would have make it more usefull
It's good once you figure it out
Latest gripe: Repeating tasks have started appearing on the prior calendar day rather than the proper repeating due day. But not always. Very weird.
Pretty useful. If you sign in to your account you can see the same information on your Windows computer.
Need more user friendly interface
"MS can't add requested ""plan tomorrow"" feature for 3 years. It's not rocket science."
Sync is a bit slow. Widget does not update very quickly either. Otherwise smooth interface and no other issues.
I set reminder for a particular time but it reminds me at some different time than the one I set and my phone always connected to internet. I wish this issue could be sorted out.
Mejorando
just started using this app its nice you can connect others to view you to do list
What's the point if the reminder alarm goes off only when I open the app? It doesn't send notifications
"Great app, but latest version had a bug that nobody seems to have reported ... All newly added items have the ""note"" icon, whether there is a note added or not."
Good. But can't share my lists.
I would prefer the ability to sync my tasks with google calendar.
All in Al its a good app but for the last couple of months the reminders aren't working. No push notifications are received. I checked all my permissions for this app and power settings but can't see anything that would prevent it from pushing notifications.. Any ideas?
Bell sound is missing when I click completed in widget mode
Egg
Layout is horrible. Give me a simple list view and the ability to hide the tacky theme.
So far so good
Widget doesn't support other list besides My Day. 5 star if functionality is added.
I can't select multiple images to add to a list. It's as if the option is there but not implemented - says I have '1 image selected' but I'm not able to select another one simultaneously
"You need to add ""Tomorrow"" tab. Because I plan my day before I sleep. So everything is ready after I wake up."
I'm close to leaving Todoist now. Loving Todo more and more. Can't jump because there's still no Alexa integration.
I still wish it had a more unique name than To-Do. like at least Wunderlist 2.0
The application accepts date and time in the past for reminder. It should verify date and time.
Google calendar is better than it
Nice app
Would be great if it linked to calendar
Ok
if give us progress it be excellent.
"I have just installed this Application, and want to know the feature of ""Assigned to me"" Please help."
Meh
"Mediocre Replacement This app is supposed to be taking the place of other list and to do makers, but it does not. This app builds Check-off lists. Nothing more, no matter how they try to dress it up. In the immortal words of Sarah Palin, ""Putting lipstick on a pig...."" This only makes check-off lists. You can't make a list with numbers or dots or dashes. You can't alphabetize it other than having still be a check-off list. Looking for another app. This one truly Microsoft sucks."
Don't have skip option is you don't want to create account. Btw app is good
seen nice so far
Widget is very buggy. Also add an option to sync with google calendar or outlook calendar.
It's great but should have some option to put my own photos on background.
Good for daily too list but not much more.
Very helpful but will be more if you can add Time Management matrix from Eisenhower. Please think of this feature
Everything is Fine Except the Notification Doesn't ring untill I open the app by myself And that is So irritating... What will be the moto of reminders if they can't remind you properly
Really frustrating that I can't have a unified My Day view for both my work and personal account. It's such a hassle switching accounts.
Real shortfall is the inability to allocate tasks and share lists outside of the organisation. Fix this and I'd give 5 stars.
"Love this app Please add a option to Remind me every day At a specific time that I choose. ""Remind me every day option"" Sometimes I repeat some task daily so I don't need to create them again and again there is option repeat the task daily but it there is no option to ""remind Daily"""
Good app.
Good app at what it does. I think there's some functionality readily available in other apps that would greatly improve this one. I'm no programmer so maybe there's a reason they can't include it
Great app. Please add a streak counter for repetitive tasks.
Nice App but still needs more improvement
Please please please add the option for duplicating tasks. Im using it for an operational purpose where i have to re do task listing from scratch. Everything else seems fine. I used to use wunderlist. And the duplicate feature is the best feature in it. Please add it soon.
"From an old Wunderkist fan: Design and migration is nice thank you. Please bring back weekly to do widget or at least make possible to select only ""earlier"" tasks to show up in widget. Additionally, in widget if due date is passed please show the task in red color. I don't want to see may tax payments next year in the widget. Please bring weekly list to the widget. Thank you."
Not getting notifications on my samsung device. Assignments that are shared do not alert me once the task is completed by the other party.
Its good
Require notification and messaging features in the app
Please tell how to get a audible alarm after setting date and time in reminder? Without an audible alarm at set date and time for any task this app is of no use to me
Fairly limited
Last app wunderlist is better than this. Beacuse if we make list under folder with defferent folders. And see list under widgets we can see only list without folder. It makes me disturbe. In wunderlist we can see list under folder in widgets. So that i like that app Please solve it
Less past-it notes. Thanks
Would love it if the tasks had an option of being hidden once completed. Otherwise I would rate 5stars
Falta muita coisa.
Good app but could be better
Doesn't sync with my phone app
Just started using it. So far so good. May change rating after using it for awhile.
It is good but it should remind us to do the tasks.
Enjoying so far. I am sure there are more capabilities I am yet to discover. Makes life so much easier
Simple app for simple tasks.
"Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from ""my day"". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!"
App is really good. But if you forget microsoft pwd is a huge pain to reset it
Great.
It's great for keeping track of a busy life! Need collaboration opportunities within the program to allow for communicating with others on what they did._u
Very good app for everyone
App is very useful however it works slow on my macbook
Occasional issues with synchronizing lists but otherwise great
Great! But need to add some feature such as privacy with fingerprint or face lock.
Please add feature that let me switch between lists by swiping right and left in list page. Thank you so much for this great app 👏👏
Convenient and great
The scheduled reminders doesn't work. The app notifies you only the first time.
Great but... We need be able to set my day list a night before.
This apps makes it easier to organise your day and goals with daily reminders. And it is a fun app because you get to customize the themes of each goal.
Please make the mobile and desktop version like the web version ...it's cleaner and more simple
Needs comment option on each task
Good
good
Good
Add copy task (with sub tasks) to clipboard. Also reorder subtasks sometimes broken. URGENT !
Just using know. Exploring more.
Great app for all my To Do lists. There are just minor issues in syncing sometimes
It's good but wish Google assistant would add to it
Great app. But if scheduled time more than 2 weeks it make it better.
It's alright.
Helpful app though some times doesn't update when someone else adds items. Bot not a frequent issue.
Simple to use and works great so far! Just wish that scheduled tasks could be shared with the calendar as an option.
Allow reminders to pop up. All in all it's ok
"I have a suggestion. In the ""All"" lists tab, please give the option of sorting the tasks within the different categories they've been created. I need both the categorisation of tasks into different groups and the ability to arrange them within those categories, say by Due Date or Alphabetically!"
Still to work out the kinks
Nice app but complicated setting are there at some points but this is best app 🙂👍👍👍👍👍 I ever used in to do works
Simple to use
Nice for productivity
Easy to use
Very useful app.
Nada mal.
Easy to Use!
This is not reminding me even though I set an remainder option
I use a daily for tasks and lists. There could be one more subcategory/sublist. It would be nice to show pictures in line too.
Well structured
Great.
It's a nice but I personally need a full screen pop up. It's convenient for me personally.
Item duplicate automatically
Slow to open. Needs an option to list in order of oldest task first. Great overall.
Great app
A search function in completed items would increase the stars to 5!
Great for getting tasks from phone to PC. Not so good at understanding long lists on phone
Very good app
Nice app
it would be great if we could have geographic reminders like when you drive home and it will remind you
Convenient
Great
Microsoft is great at listening to reviews. I still miss Wunderlist but To Do is close.
6. Xz
Keeps me organized
Excellent app for sharing tasks across family members. Would give it more stars if it worked as the task app for Outlook
Very good for managing tasks and very efficient in collaborating with others
Great organizational tool. I use it every day.
Works well with Office products
Great app! Thank you Microsoft.
Fine app Would be better if we could sync it with other apps as well.
Simple and Neat. Wish it could let me add priority on tasks and allow me to reorder the tasks within Planned tab.
Good
Needs more work. Notes are awkward; maybe what I want is something simpler.
I think the app with a time table for sorting tasks will become more useful .
Awesome and Esay to use.
Good app that syncs with Outlook. Widget needs transparent options.
"""My day"" is a great feature. But perhaps it will help to be able to plan it atleast the previous evening."
They should give some type of sound feedback when u finish a task
"4 stars because ""location based reminders"" is missing. Best Task management app in 2020."
Very good
Please add time stamps and ranking to sub tasks in each task.
This app is so good but can be better on remainder
I like this app.
Excellent...👍 App But Please.. Add Recycle-Bin in the app
Very Good
Very nice app. Using it regularly to get reminders.
It is a real time management tool.
"Very easy to use and share with your family. You can create groups and asign tasks. I don't add the last start because it is easy to click done and I use it at the market. Then something can be changed to ""done"" and you forget to buy..."
The worst thing is it's not integrated with one drive to attach or edit file.
Good
I would like a more in depth prioritization system beyond a star. Thinking the quadrants from the #7habits of highly effective people.
Shopping grocery lists-/apointments-/on all devices to update and edit when you think of it
Good Application
Great to do list. Waiting for new features. Eg notes should have a comment section with Timestamp
Useful with good UI
Very good app and easy to use.
Great App but need to add mark complete check.
Nice
Very good app for day to day planning
Please add option to sort by reminder time
"Pretty good app. Would get 5 stars if: 1. It had ""Delete all checked items"", and 2. The reminder used the Android alert system."
Helps to become more productive. Not using AI or recommendation engines.
Good
i would like to set a background from pictures from my gallery not from the ones you gave me
Very useful
Need custom notification tone.
Syncs nicely between 2 users
Good
Enjoying it thus far
Doesnt show you task in outlook calendar Planned task aren't shown in My day when they are actual
Very good application trustable from Microsoft.
Simple and easy to use. Syncs on phone and pc which is very useful
"Would like to see an option for ""delete all completed tasks"", instead of having to select one at a time."
"Really good app and I like ""My Day"" function, but still has lots things need to improve, e.g. Batch Insert function, it already could sync with outlook task but without subtask, that a shame. I believe that this app could be very powerful if it could work with outlook and OneNote. Also, its time to concern supported Wear OS."
از حیث ابعاد مختلفی کامله، مثل امکان گروه بندی، امکان آپلود فایل، امکان ساخت «ساب تسک»، تنظیم سر رسید، تنظیم یادآور، امکان شیر وعهده‌گذاری کار‌ها به علاوه محیط بسیار کاربر پسند. تنها مشکل اینه برای «ساب‌تسک‌ها» نمی‌توان تاریخ سر رسید و عهده‌گذاری داشت، و میزان و نحوه روند انجام کار امکان نمایش ندارد. * برای دوستان لازم می‌دونم بگم بین محیط ویندوز و اندروید به خوبی همگام سازی میشه و همچنین هر تقویمی که دستگاه روش نصب باشه رو نمایش می‌ده.(یعنی برای ویندوز ۱۰ تقیم کامل جلالی)
Very good use app
Would be more effective if there was an option to add reminders for subtasks and option to add time deadline along with due date.
I like the app. Easy to use and organize. I just wished there was a way to turn the spell check off in it. It's miserable trying to type non-European style names in it.
Amazing app I am very happy to follow my tasks jobs etc.amazing app.but I want the developers to keep an option which will continue everyday the same tasks it would be nice I have to always write my tasks daily
It's very useful for the All
Love it! Helps me to stay organized so mych more. Love the detailed features as well!
If have difference label or Icon can be used then is better
Ok
Very useful. Would like tasks dated today to appear automatically in My Day.
"Excellent. Some unique features that make this my go to android task app. Although, some other features either don't exist or are hard to find. In future updates the following additions would be handy: - Create and sync tasks using OneNote App (currently desktop only) - Assign Calendar Event (currently desktop only) - have an option to plan tomorrows ""My Day"" or even roll over incomplete tasks from today to tomorrow."
Very useful app 👍
App keeps asking for access to other apps we high i do not want to permit.
The app is near perfect. It has just one flaw for me: adding pictures or files or other attachments. Why do I need to be online to add files to a reminder? Please make attaching files available offline to add an extra layer of convenience.
Very useful
its nice
Great
It's easy to use and perfect for all my lists!
Top Notch. Easy to use and manage tasks or projects. The reminders don't send full notifications quite often so a little bug to work on there.
Fairly easy to use. Very useful for shopping lists and to do lists
It's overall very nice but small things keep frustrating me. One particular thing is Why can't you add reminders for custom days? Why pick a specific day?
So far from my user experience(switch from any do)Already good & keeps getting better every update thank microsoft team
"Fairly good looking app. If you cancel notification it doesn't remind you that the team hasn't completed. Would like a more, ""naggy"" for individual tasks."
Great app Simultaneously connects to desktop.
Add. Memo with overlapping facilities of diff. Memos.
Amazing
It would be nice if you could color code tasks. Otherwise a very good app.
Es muy completo para lo que necesito
Easy to use . One additional feature you can add is to provide an option in themes where we can set some inspiring quotes from our gallery.
Great application. However application is a bit not responsive.
Perfekt vor Produktliste. Schwer mit Ordner umgehen
This helps so much getting things done. It's so satisfying to make stuff off the list. 5 stars can't live without
Nice
"The ""search"" feature is much faster than the last app I was using. I feel empowered 👍"
Would appreciate a more attractive alarm with reminders
Runs Good
Satisy all of my needs
Good
A grate app i use it every day
It's very easy to use. This app has made my life so much more organized!
This app is so helpful in my day to day life!
Thank u for making this app fire five stars to it😜😜🤯
Simple to use.
Bery guud hahayes!
A1
Best app
Nice app. Improved to do version.
I find it very helpful to keep track of my day and keeps me on task.
Ok
Excellent very helpful a good way to share tasks with somebody we use it to buy groceries for example when we're in Costco one person can find one thing and the other person can find another thing and you check it off and you know it's been found that makes it very fantastic!
Система Дорофеев отлично ложится в этот инструмент. Рекомендую!
"O aplicativo é muito bom porém algumas coisas precisam ser melhoradas. Primeiro, deveria ter um opção que você gravasse uma mensagem de voz registrando a tarefa por via de áudio. Segundo, deveria ter uma opção de tarefa não cumprida, um ""x vermelho"" que indica que a tarefa não foi cumprida, porque quando eu registro uma tarefa para ser feita diariamente e algum dia eu não a cumpra, não tem a opção de registrá-la como não feita e enquanto eu não colocá-la como feita o app não põe no dia seguinte."
Excellent
Nic
Better than google task
So far so good...all wonderfully arranged according to my way and my headings...easy to use I only realized now that it shows under a different name with my number...how do I edit this?
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Very good performance 😊
Helpful for my daily activities notes. Thanks a lot.
Excellent App! Keeps me organized.
This app helps me to be more organised.
Great!
Customizable and syncs nice across all our devices.
Very user frendly and easy to communicate in corporate gruops
Disks
Awesome application thankyou microsoft
Best to do app ever
Highly recommended for any one trying to overcome procrastination
Wonderful!
I love this app
Simpan and easy
Great
Very useful to quickly make a list or have a long one for like a grocery list right on your phone.
Best app... pls add function of multiple intraday alarms for any task.
Im enjoying the structure of this app.
Great app...Unless your spouse controls it. 😁
Works
Agregar una opción para poner una nota general en una lista de tareas.
Just what I needed
Wonderful app.
"I use it as the grocery list for when I shop. Everybody in my family used to wait until I was busy doing something else to tell me about what they needed from the store and they would assume that since ""they told me"" that I heard them or retained the information which made for a lot of disappointments. So I shared the app with the family so everybody can add to the list as needed for themselves. As far as my family is concerned, it's a life saver (for them 🙂)."
Best reminder and organizer app
Easy to use and does what it says.
Simple and useful 👍
Good and easy to use
Super
Multi functional app for daily tasks routine
👍🏻🙏🏻👍🏻EXCELLENT AND FREQUENT UPDATES! PLEASE IMPROVE NOTIFICATIONS FOR QUERIES & COMMENTS!!! 🤩😇🤩😇
Does everything.
That's awesome 🤩💓 easy and fast
Love it 😊
Almost as good as wunderlist
Finally!!! After looking for several months I found the perfect to-do app that is ****not annoying. Thanks Microsoft
Ajterth
Good
It's amazing I really like it it's so easy and you can use it anytime and it's encourage you to do your work faster and it's so good 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Good task reminder app. Very intergration with 0365
Excellent app for setting up ur daily routine.
Great app
"For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, ""tomorrow"" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap ""remind me in half an hour"" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them."
I love it!
Excellent app.
Works well for me. Several lists.
A good app
It helps me remember things.
Love that my husband and I can share our lists!
Beautiful layout and well developed
Very good
Awesome and multi device sharing.
Easy to keep yourself organised and prioritise your todos
Absolutely astonishing!
Love this app and office 365 in general
The new update brings a lot that was desired. Most importantly list sharing with much better approach than wunderlist. But task assigning within the shared list and chat on a particular task is still missing and this is something that still holds me back from fully migrating from Wunderlist.
Best of the best
Very nice app must try
Awesome
The best thing to type and remember our list
Application is much nice but windows application having much synchronization issues. It would be big improvement if it gets sync across all devices specially windows application.
Free
Better than other app
Easy to use and very helpful
This added significantly to my recent productivity hights.
Nice app.
Love it
Great app Easiest and most customisable app in playstore
Splendid life-work organizing method
I'm a student and this app helps me a lot
Great app to organise your tasks
The preview video sold me after 30s. Didn't even watch the last 15s.
Love it!
Thank you devs for an amazing app! All in one without the unnecessary waste the others provide for a fee. Strongly recommend anyone reading for download confirmation. Don't forget to cancel your subscription to the other waste of money/space.
"Error: Can't add a step after other with an enter, you ought to go to bottom. // Lacks: Can't search your tasks or, steps, with an option ""search"" into lists or steps sections."
Amazing! Superb!
Extremely good for work
Love the fact it updates all 3 of my devices
Perfect
I absolutely love it love it love it this is a good Microsoft to-do list and you can take it anywhere on the phone now and Markoff anything I love it hope it doesn't change its taste just as good as it is now
Very useful app.
Very good tool for day to day use
It will only alarm if you will open the app
Feels very intuitive. The steps feature is awesome. I wish that the other tasks can be merged to another task to form as another step. It would be great to group and order random ideas without needing to look for other related tasks. But my love for this app is there. xx
Simply superb!!
Best app for planing and to do.. ;]
Most useful to do list there is. Wish had more time features so i can short tasks by their deadlines (what hour they finish)
Excellent
It is excellent for your Info updated.
Nice
Helps me get things done
Is only a good list everything you need
