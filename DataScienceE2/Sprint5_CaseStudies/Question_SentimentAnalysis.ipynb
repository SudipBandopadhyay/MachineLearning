      "since joining their very affordable monthly subscription, i've found ticktick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine, and it's actually helping me be more productive even though i'm a pretty begrudging procrastinator. first off, the widgets. god, i love the widgets! the first thing i see after unlocking my phone is a) a list of all the stuff i need to be doing on that given day; and b) a cute visual checklist of daily habits that i need to also make time for. this was what i found was missing back when i used the todoist app, was a simple means of having both habits and to-dos living in the same shared ecosystem. i suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features, but what's here is perfectly functional, and easily integrates into your regular 'inbox'/'today' lists. the widgets update dynamically, right along with the full-screen app, and also with the pc and web integrations. this was a \"must-have\" feature, because i've tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget, and seeing them \"refreshed\" into existence several minutes later in the app itself. ticktick makes everything instant, to the point that a ticktick notification 'pings' on my phone at the precise moment it also 'pings' on my laptop. i really can't understate how useful the widget and cross-platform integration is, because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what i'm meant to be doing at any random moment, it's so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important tasks/habits slap me in the face, demanding my attention. this also ties in nicely with the way notifications/alerts work. i've got reminders set on all my habits, and when the reminders go off, they actually \"take over\" the entire screen, at which point i can tick them off, or dig into the more extensive options on the back-end. there's a few areas i can see for quality-of-life improvements, though i'm optimistic that their subscription model means we haven't seen the \"final\" iteration of this app for some time yet. a few things that jump out at me over a couple months' usage: -- to mark a habit as \"incomplete\", you can't just double-tap the checkbox for an 'x' mark, you have to open the app, pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard, go into its settings, and the option is buried all the way in the app's back-end menus. it's a minor gripe, but when compounded over weeks or months of use, it's easy to just not bother marking your \"failures\" at all. it makes me wonder if there's other useful features i've missed just because they're not readily accessible on the front end ui + widgets. -- it would be nice if habits displayed in the widget + front-end ui had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on \"streak\" for. you can track those metrics, but again it's hidden in the robust-yet-opaque back-end, accessible via sub-menus and abstract graphs, rather than being loudly displayed front-and-centre. i'd probably be more motivated to \"keep the streak going\" with a given habit if i could see at a split-second glance how today's efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days, or whatever. --also, you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week, or a certain number of times per week, but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if you're on track or falling behind. by which i mean, when i pull up my habits for thursdayy, for instance, and i see \"exercise at gym\" in my list of habits for that day, then surely i should get some indication of \"you've been to the gym x times this week so far, and you have y gym sessions remaining for this week [in order to fulfil your habitual obligations]\". again, the information is there in the app, but you have to actively seek it out. maybe the more fastidious time-keepers will see to this without batting an eye, but for forgetful, adhd-prone types like myself, if it's not right in front of me then it might as well not exist. but all in all, these are minor foibles. fantastic app. 5/5.\n",

      "this is a re-review. this could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. just don't confuse the 'game' in rpg for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. however do it now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. after a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. while auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. user defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. with no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. there is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. finally it's expensive as apps go. a one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. original review: \"a good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. it would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.\"\n",

      "for me, the best app for organizing your life. but some things should be improved though: 1. you can't set monday as the first day of the week. 2. having some of your notes appear both in planned and tasks and some in planned but not in tasks is bewildering. besides planned and tasks there are two more lists - my day and important. why so many overlapping lists? 3. you can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. for example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. you can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. you can't set quick alarm. for example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. there's no such option. 5. you can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. you can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. anyone can read them.\n",
