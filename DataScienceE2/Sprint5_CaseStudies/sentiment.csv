2,Very costly for the premium version (approx Indian Rupees 910 per year). Better to download the premium version of this app from apkmos website and use it. Microsoft to do list app is far more better.,Positive,1

15,7 days for free and then you pay. Plus too complicated for some simple tasks,Positive,1
16,Update: thanks for your response. I would ask the developers to check their own app. There is NO monthly subscription option in the app. Old review: No monthly subscriptions?

35,Subscription?? How does this application figure that it can be a subscription application? Ridiculous Update after developer response: This is not a subscription application. You are not Netflix or Adobe. This should be a standalone app quit trying to milk people's money. You can say anything you want. THIS WILL NEVER BE A SUBSCRIPTION APPLICATION.

43,"I should have looked through ""most recent"" instead of ""most relevant"" reviews. It's far too limited for me in it's free state and I'm not interested in paying for a subscription just to unlock what should be basic functionality in a to do list app.",Positive,1
44,do not for showing or refund&refuse about my persional privacy.,Negative,0
45,"It doesn't have sub lists, e.g. ""child/school"", ""child/health"" so you see too many lists or too many tasks at once (which is overwelming).",Negative,0

58,"Update ruined app Last update re-formatted the ""Plan My Day"" function so the ability to schedule tasks for that day or postpone into the future is unusable, so I have 50+ tasks and to way to arrange them into a comprehensive order.

70,Makes simple things extremely complicated,Negative,0
71,Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.,Positive,1
72,The latest update now not working fine at all. It's worsening day by day. The developers now appears to have a different intention that premium paid version is purchased by the users.,Negative,0
73,Just use your basic phone calendar,Negative,0
74,I want to cancel the subscription.,Negative,0
75,MoneyGrabber Wants you to pay premium to choose specific dates.,Negative,0
76,Does not do much different than Google tasks (which is easier to use and is free). As a result I wanted a refund as I only realized this after my 7 day trial. Refunds are only given within 24 hours of their drawing their fee. Not sure that is legal for an automatic subscription after app trial.,Positive,1

If you include a feature, make sure it actually works.",Positive,1
113,"Any.Forget... Had an instance of daily repeating event, that I have marked as complete today and somehow it did skip the next day and only proceeded to the day after.

155,"App shouldn't enforce sign in for use. Uninstalled. Waste of time. Edit: that sounds like optional functionality for an app labeled to do list! Not a complete blocker to using the app. For a simple ""I need to make a quick note to remind myself of later"" this isn't very good.",Positive,1

165,"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app.",Positive,1

182,not user friendly.,Positive,1
183,Used to love this app. After the latest update its garbage! Can't turn off the automatic date/time thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time. Will hang onto it for a bit in hopes that a new update will fix this issue. Or at least give the option to turn it off.,Positive,1
184,I love using this app however when I installed it to one of my phones I cannot login to it. It just keeps closing. I don't know what's wrong. Also I wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks.,Positive,1

189,"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess.",Negative,0
190,Free version is very limited compared to Ticktick and Microsoft To Do.,Positive,1
191,"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this.",Negative,0
192,I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff,Positive,1

201,There is a issue with Notes. For as long as I can remeber you sometimes add a note and it's gone later. I keep having to go out and come back each time I add one in hope it's saved.,Positive,1
202,I like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing ... it's imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee.. they justify it by saying it's a service blabla it's an to do app. More people would actually pay for it if it wouldn't be a subscription model.,Negative,0
203,Nice polished but useless. There is no filter for tags. Web and app synch problems happens missing tasks. Not any scoring system. May good for amateurs but not for project managers. However I like the calendar view.,Positive,1
204,There are certain things I love like the fact that it sorts my grocery list by aisle automatically. But overall this app stresses me out. I just want an app that allows me to share my grocery list. But the grocery list seems buried in an area that isn't intuitive. I don't need something to schedule every second of my life which seems to be more this apps aim.,Positive,1

209,Missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items!!!,Negative,0
210,It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.,Positive,1

246,So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.,Positive,1

249,Many times I've put sub tasks on my to-do tasks and they just disappear for some reason. I've forgotten many things because of this and still hasn't been fixed despite various updates.,Negative,0
250,App not bad but very limited unless you pay. Downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's WhatsApp integration. That is only available if you pay. Without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app.,Negative,0
251,Questionable experience. Upgraded to premium but WhatsApp integration is not working. Seems a little confusing.,Negative,0
252,Zero features in free version.,Positive,1
253,I can not figure out how to get it on my galaxy watch...ugh.,Negative,0
254,I was given this premium app. Now with new versions is not updating. I fail to understand this. If I'm given premium version then now why wouldn't it get updated? If it was non upgradable then why was it given? It's a great app and so it hurts when there are such tricks used on customers.,Negative,0
255,"Useful as a to-do list. Sets a real annoying ""plan your day"" popup reminder every morning. How you disable it is non obvious. Uninstalled.",Positive,1
256,"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!",Positive,1
257,Reminder feature is not working 🥱,Negative,0
258,I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.,Negative,0
259,I used to love it. It was my go to app for many years. But over the time it is losing the special status. It doesn't have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times. They removed that!,Positive,1
260,Good app. Annoying pop up every morning on my phone even though I have the notification turned off.,Positive,1
261,I haven't used they made an effort from there side. I'm a bit of a mess and I need time.,Negative,0
262,"29.9. Nothing new, I've already reconciled to that ""improved"" GUI. // 16.7.20, 3.8.19: No, a long time ago I was able to create a FULL (WITH a reminder) task in a LANDSCAPE mode. It's impossible now (after that 'redesign'). // 17.7., 2.3.: I'm pretty sure I WAS ABLE to create/edit a new task in ONE go (and in LANDSCAPE). It takes MORE moves now. // 2.2.2019: I CANNOT believe that when I HAVE got to change a grip from PORTAIT to LANDSCAPE when creating / editing a task it is more effective than before...",Positive,1
263,"Some features just don't work in the free app! I have tried to set a daily reminder for 9am to put a ticket in my car. Once I click ""Done"", it sets the reminder the next day.... at 1am. I dismissed the 1am reminder once, half asleep as the sound woke me up, it never reminded me again and now I have a parking fine to pay. I have real memory difficulties and need an app that actually works properly! Disappointing, as I find the one off reminders really helpful.",Negative,0
264,I am not sure who want to pay monthly fee for a to-do list app. One time payment always make a sense.,Positive,1
265,Features are all right. It doesn't seem to me like they actually USE their own product. Else the idiosyncrasies would have been ironed out.,Positive,1
266,Didn't like,Positive,1
267,"Now able to see list view from widget thanks to developer response - but there's a new bigger problem now. The integration with Google Assistant is going terribly. Everytime I try to add an item to my grocery list through Google Assistant, Any.do creates a new list called ""Grocery"". When I ask what's on my grocery list, it replies ""you have 3 lists named Grocery, which would you like?""",Positive,1
268,It was awesome at first. Then I try to add an event from the widget and it won't do it correctly. Super frustrated,Positive,1
269,"The Next 7 Days is No Longer Showing ""the next 7 days"" but rather group by lists and not by days..",Negative,0
270,I pay for the premium app and it keeps closing down on me once Im in the app. What can I do to keep that from happening?,Negative,0
271,Almost perfect app just one thing I wish anydo had is hourly reminders and copy reminders to set the same task just a different time... This is coming from a PAID subscriber...,Positive,1
272,What happened to the missed calls notification? I recently switched phones and had to download the new version and the option is no longer there. It was one of the main reasons I used the app.,Negative,0
273,"To be fair, I downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes. The reason for this is that I hate apps that scream ""pay me money"" since the instance you download it, and this one did that exactly. With the ""free premium trial"" being in your face all the time, and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is ""premium"". Just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it. It looks amazing though.",Positive,1
274,Love it. Great future.👪🙌,Positive,1
275,So nice,Positive,1
276,fantastic,Positive,1
277,Too many options and gets too fancy for an app that should just have simple functionality to setup reminders and to do items,Negative,0
278,Way too expensive; if there was a monthly option I may consider going premium.,Negative,0
279,Great UI an reminder app. Only downside is I cant mute notifications for certain accounts which is really annoying. I'd like to see my events but not have notifications for them as I have a ton.,Positive,1
280,Just not for me. They also seem to refuse to let you delete your account by refusing a password that was created 15 seconds. Lots of cool features but not what I'm looking for.,Negative,0

289,mobile app isn't very intuitive but the desktop app is good,Positive,1
290,"All around amazing life improver with one irritating caveat. The reordering functionality could really use some work. Often the reordering fails and the task gets thrown out of ""Today"" into ""Someday"" which means I have to go fish it out from a long list. Sometimes this will happen multiple times in a row really testing my patience. Been dealing with it for many months now - want to continue using this awesome app but really struggling with this one bug. Galaxy S9+, Android 10, One UI 2.1",Positive,1
291,The day ended and i didnt end my task and it didnt shift or alarm about undone tasks,Positive,1
292,It's not what i need,Negative,0
293,It had a peculiar issue.. I have set it up to remind me of my ask with on screen notification but often it fails to do so and then I miss the task.,Negative,0

298,I love the widget but whenever I edit an event on the calendar it changes the day to like the day before without me doing so and it's extremely annoying,Positive,1
299,How to get the pop up for missing call alerts,Negative,0
300,"The latest app update (7/26/20), ""new app navigation..."" is a definite downgrade, from panes to a one side scroll, now I can no longer see full task list names, the ""all tasks"" option is changed, the new layout sucks. Why do developers always do this, ""fix"" things that aren't broken? Why can't you just improve the things people are requesting, instead of changing everything else around too? This ver is much harder/inconvenient to navigate than the previous one was. Trying to revert to older.",Negative,0

313,I paid for premium account. But my account status is still free with no premium feature.,Positive,1

319,Very limited without premium,Negative,0
320,Best GUI with few bugs,Positive,1
321,I left a review earlier that was one star. While the app wasn't for me (I found that it was confusing and didn't suit my needs so I deleted it shortly after) The customer service was fantastic. I was charged for a subscription even though I didn't use the app because I made a mistake in canceling the subscription. I sent an email detailing my problem and asking for a refund. The response was quick and a refund was granted I thought it was only fair to come back and leave a nicer review.,Positive,1
322,I just downloaded the app not quite long. I've started to enjoy it but there's one problem. The widget is usually empty even though there are tasks in the app. What can I do about it?,Negative,0
323,برنامه عالیه اما اکثر امکاناتش پولیه,Negative,0
324,Nice,Positive,1
325,Very handy if you're going shopping or need reminders on what you want to purchase. Easy to use and plenty of features.,Positive,1
326,I really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me.,Positive,1
327,Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.,Positive,1
328,Its okay so far but im not sure on how to find the focusing tree part in order for me to stay focused just wondering how you do it other than that not too bad of an app,Positive,1

333,Tried it. The app worked well but found something that works better for me personally..🙃,Positive,1

335,This site is most suitable for those who wanted to get a jobs from home Thanks a lot,Positive,1
336,Great app. But I am not getting notifications even when i set time to remind,Positive,1
337,Going for free and better Microsoft To-do,Positive,1
338,So far I'm not impressed and I don't see where it's worth over $40 a year to use... I'm really trying to use it for everything since I did pay for it but to me it's just not worth it.,Positive,1
339,Not bad,Negative,0
340,Will not let me start the free trial or for that matter purchase an upgrade so for now since it's stuck like me 3. Get it fixed and I'll improve score.,Positive,1
341,Delet,Negative,0
342,Thank you 😊,Positive,1
343,Features available in many apps for free are paid here...,Positive,1
344,I would normally give this 5 stars but the past few days the widget has not allowed me to make tasks on future dates. It just puts the task on todays date. And you cant put tasks on random future days either. Tomorrow yes but i like to plan ahead of tomorrow,Positive,1
345,Super,Positive,1
346,don't understand collaborative editing,Negative,0
347,Not very user-friendly. I found it hard to navigate and find what I wanted. It works nicely and I appreciate the simple art style.,Positive,1

349,Can't edit the time of a scheduled task and no sound/alarm notifications for the tasks. Edit- sound issue resolved. But still having issues with editing tasks. Not a very user friendly interface.,Positive,1

351,Gud,Negative,0
352,Great app and does what I want it to do. (Is my prefered habit tracker ) However I believe the colours should not be a premium feature. Far too expensive as it is the only reason I would get premium! Perhaps make adding wallpapers from gallery a premium feature?,Positive,1
353,Reminder sound not sounding,Negative,0
354,It is better than the normal app in your phone I only wish their was better support for the calendar,Positive,1
355,Need more user friendly interface. But very useful application my mobile.,Positive,1
356,Everything is great. But the sort by time isn't working properly.,Positive,1
357,I asked seven days trial to see whether I like or not and you have already taken the money for the whole entire year that is a rip-off,Positive,1
358,Tried to share a list with my husband but it won't share between my Office account and his Personal account. It's a show stopper.,Positive,1
359,All good. Should work on calendar,Positive,1
360,Love it!! But can't afford premium😞,Positive,1
361,"I have been using this app for years and previous update of ""next 7 days"" update is amazing. I usally plan my day in morning and use widget to view my today's tasks but now app widget shows tasks by category not by next 7 days which has created a serious issue for me. I highly recommend in widget show tasks by day wise list not by category wise otherwise for me and for many this app is useless.",Positive,1
362,1) It has a calendar feature but you can't customize the calendar events repetition as much as you can in google (can do daily but not 5 days a week all in one entry). 2) edit: figured the task sorting part out. Sort by time and collapse upcoming/tomorrow and it will just show your daily tasks. I like that. But it's still not worth paying for unless the calendar event customization is as good as Google's since that is free.,Positive,1
363,Very 👌 nice,Positive,1
364,Great app. but buggy. Keeps asking me to delete all completed tasks even though it's empty,Positive,1
365,Good,Positive,1
366,nice,Positive,1
367,Initial upgrade hid the separation of today tomorrow upcoming and someday. After sorting and adding new tasks all of sudden they all showed up again. Don't know why this happened. If these features go away it will make this app much harder to use. The bug freaked me out and cause me to write a very bad review which I have since edited and amended,Negative,0
368,Best app for ur task management. Edit: for 5 stars u can add more theme options for free version,Positive,1
369,Why notifications are too short? I want to be able custmize my noti sounds!!!,Positive,1
370,還算不錯用！簡單易操作,Negative,0
371,This is my best to do apps so far and I like it very much. I wish there are some tutorial to give some advice on how to use all the apps potential. And maybe some connection with google assistant and over voice command.,Positive,1
372,Dark theme should be free 😢,Positive,1
373,Have the free version and even that is quite useful in terms of ease of use and integration with calendars. Now thinking of upgrading. Could get a 5 then.,Positive,1

379,This rating is for the free version. Most feature rich free version I've tried of other to do list type apps. Interface takes some getting used to but great features and everything seems to be working.,Positive,1
380,It would be better if there's an icon beside the task so I can easily identify whether a task has some note to it.,Positive,1
381,So great. I have suggested this app to many a friend. Suggestion: have the ability to custom the repeat feature in the events. Sometimes things repeat every week but only for 5 weeks.,Positive,1
382,It's good app for all,Positive,1
383,I love it so far.,Positive,1
384,Great,Positive,1

403,Decent app,Negative,0
404,It helps me to remember what to do as I forget sometimes. It's a nice application but there would be a slight change in it. There must be a ringtone to remember not any message. As people see calls not messages as my opinion.,Positive,1
405,Getting better with each up date.,Positive,1

427,Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?,Positive,1
428,99% percent love this app! I would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another. It's annoying to other people nearby when I'm using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day. Otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs.,Positive,1

440,Great,Positive,1
441,Great app for tracking tasks. Could use some work on gesture/finger detection. For example I will always accidentally close the text field for a new note when trying to hit save. Pro version is good but a little pricy for the benefits.,Positive,1
442,Its a very good app...the only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thing..it dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened. However i have already given all the notification rights. Dear any.do team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings.

445,"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult.",Negative,0

481,"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.",Negative,0
482,Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??,Negative,0
483,UPDATE: Tags have started syncing back again. Tags do not sync between the mobile and desktop app. I am a premium user and I put in a ticket about the issue. After frequent back and forth over the email the issue hasn't been resolved yet. I will update my rating after the issue has been fixed.,Positive,1
484,"Integrates well with my work flow. I had difficulty in understanding the 'My Lists' so instead I ""listed"" My projects instead...works, now integrates well with what I do and the tags differentiates similar project ""lists"". I accidentally deleted my shopping list when I really wanted to remove some items...but its growing on me.",Positive,1
485,Is this a free app or have to subscribe (& pay) to use beyond 7 days?,Positive,1
486,Only one suggestion: an option for big tasks. Sometimes i have a big task that i will complete over multiple days and it would be cool to be able to check off a little bit at a time.,Positive,1

522,Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!,Positive,1

WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects.

I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.",Negative,0

The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).",Negative,0

Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything.

That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,Positive,1
886,Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update.

Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden.

984,Having some problems figuring out what all this app offers; still learning it.,Negative,0
985,Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked,Positive,1
986,Repeating previous posts- don't bother with the free version if you cannot pay the premium. It's just a shell not worth the space it requires.,Positive,1
987,"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform. The simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective, enjoyable, & my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured. It helped me greatly.",Positive,1
988,I wish more options be available to free version,Positive,1
989,App is good to use but it's premium so Not using now.,Positive,1
990,Great way to start to get organized!,Positive,1
991,Frustrating update plans.,Negative,0
992,There is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless I know the smart commands.,Positive,1
993,👍,Negative,0
994,Keeps me focused!! But I don't want to purchase anything. I think it could all be free in my opinion.,Positive,1
995,Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.,Positive,1
996,"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled.",Negative,0
997,Great app,Positive,1
998,Please provide undo and redo for all actions,Positive,1
999,Phone: Samsung Galaxy J7 Star I just started using the app. I'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly.,Negative,0
1000,Good,Positive,1
1001,"Very long time user. Latest updates are making things harder. Subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again. Example: I have a weekly todo titled ""Groceries"" with grocery items I need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task. Whereas before I could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when I go shopping again, it's now completely gone.",Negative,0
1002,Not user friendly. Free version very limited.,Positive,1
1003,Will this be available for computers soon?,Negative,0
1004,Excellent,Positive,1
1005,Would be 5 stars for sure except I can't add a task to the top of the list. It is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift. And they do know about the idea per the forums. Love everything else.,Positive,1
1006,"Please add support to add a task at any position (something like ""add task below/above"" )this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version",Positive,1
1007,"Really like the app, but I've found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view, for some sections the tasks don't appear and the ""add another task"" button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position.",Positive,1
1008,It is a great app. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications,Positive,1

1021,It helps me keep up with daily chores. Having the reminder emails is a plus.,Positive,1
1022,Good for tasks.,Positive,1
1023,This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.,Positive,1
1024,Simple. Intuitive. Effective.,Positive,1
1025,Basic functions work all well. Good UI and sectionings of works. Will get you through the basic needs.,Positive,1
1026,I like that everything I need to do is right in one app with a reminder! Loving it! It also allows lists withing the list you are making.,Positive,1
1027,[Review update] It's a good thing I put my subscription renewal date in Todoist as a task because they don't send you any notification that your subscription is running out.,Positive,1
1028,The date search doesn't work in Chinese. It understand Chinese date in a wrong way.,Negative,0
1029,Pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added. I dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me.,Negative,0
1030,"Хорошее приложение. Есть подзадачи, а время и дату напоминалке можно указывать текстом. Например, ""завтра в 20""",Negative,0
1031,Why editing task is so difficult. Intuitively I long press to edit but no response. Then I have to figure out here and there to find how to edit.,Negative,0
1032,Pretty good so far,Positive,1
1033,The automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes. It would also be nice to have a maps integration - I do not think it is there.,Negative,0
1034,It's good but not perfect because I have same tasks everyday and the tasks I kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason I am switching to ticktick,Positive,1
1035,good if u are a to do list person,Positive,1
1036,Okey,Negative,0
1037,It's lived up to what it say it would do,Negative,0
1038,I think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect! I find myself constantly going back and forth between Todoist and Google calendar to schedule my stuff! All in all a great app though,Positive,1

1043,Best app ever! But we cant resort task from widget 😕 plz add this feature tnx alot❤,Positive,1
1044,"Task sections with a ""/” in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",Positive,1
1045,Works great!,Positive,1
1046,Pretty cool app the best for to list or management I've ever used.,Positive,1
1047,Better than all the other dozen other similar apps I've tried.,Positive,1
1048,Good list app. Simple to use.,Positive,1
1049,So far good. Need to check for add-ons,Positive,1
1050,It's the best In my opinion. But I feel tasks should not just be overdue. I think introducing an option to indicate that you didn't do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks,Positive,1
1051,It was a gud experience and I found it useful to plan my exam schedule priorities.,Positive,1
1052,Enjoying offloading from my head and the app telling me what I've scheduled from the day. Great for busy minds,Positive,1

1115,"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist.",Positive,1

1322,To view your calendar you have to sign up & then after you sign up it say you have to upgrade & by upgrade they mean buy it for a month subscription or pay for a year. 😅 Can't really use it for it's intended purpose without having to buy it.

1483,"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.",Positive,1

1485,A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019,Negative,0
1486,When i share my task on whatsapp Even though i selected share title and content It only shares title Version : 5.2.2 & If i share my task in the form of image the task with long name The end of the name gets replaced with ... Instead of showing the remaining heading on new line,Positive,1
1487,Loved this app until it stopped syncing... My android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks,Positive,1
1488,I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...,Positive,1
1489,All the main options are charged. Then why list the app for free. Might as well list it as charged app,Positive,1

1497,The app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay $3 a month just to see a calendar.,Negative,0
1498,App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.,Positive,1
1499,i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i can't add another subscription to the msny i already have,Positive,1

1501,The notification on my Tickwatch C2 has no vibration 📳 please fix,Positive,1
1502,Serviceable but not awesome by any means. I've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that I feel like I can't bail even though I don't love it. It's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like I want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app. Nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app.,Positive,1
1503,TickTick please give us students a discount like Todoist!! You lost a user!,Positive,1
1504,"The app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning. It is also not possible to start using the app without the ""free trial period"" as far as I have seen. After the forced free trial period I now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and. app simultaneously is indeed a premium function. This seems awful lot like the way Evernote took, I want to buy my apps because I appreciate the work, not because I'm forced into.",Positive,1
1505,I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.,Positive,1

1517,"App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined.

We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal.

1519,The features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access. Will not buy something with so little real use testing.,Positive,1
1520,User Interface not friendly,Positive,1
1521,Not good. No option to edit tasks (or correct spellings) once entered. Setting time and date not intuitive. Too many steps to make a single entry. Many other drawbacks. Not recommended.,Positive,1
1522,"Another crappy todo list app I have to delete. I dont understand, all I want is a simple to do list!!! I keep trying to add an item, and it automatically goes into my ""inbox""- whatever that means. I went to the ""help center"" to find a solution, but a long list of topics that isnt searchable is completely useless!!!",Positive,1
1523,Add option remind at specific location instead of time only. If this is already there can you please educate me how to use that?,Positive,1
1524,Simplicity but not too simple like Google Tasks. Even the free version is alright if it would actually work as promised. The attachment function is EXTREMELY flaky and unreliable. I lost important pictures as I thought they have been secured into the cloud but they haven't or just half of the picture. No error message was given when uploading via Android. Without the attachment feature TickTick is nothing special compared to similar apps so I deinstalled it.,Positive,1
1525,It's good if you're willing to spend so much money. How Annoying.,Positive,1
1526,"When i remove all app in recent. I didnt get any notification about my

1530,"Since installing it, it's needed updates every day. I just think software 
shouldn't need daily updates.",Negative,0
1531,"Used to be my fav app for task app.. But there are many features missing.. 
Themes are paid.. There is no local back up option.. I lost my tasks 3 
times.. 3 times i had to add them again.. Going to tasks now.. Much better 
app!",Positive,1
1532,"Its Ok. It has the only decent widget in any todo app, but it lacks 
integrations with much of anything (no Google Assistant, no Wear OS, no 
IFTTT) despite pages of user requests on their site. Severely limits it's 
usefulness beyond a very basic Todo list on your phone. Also, you can't 
bulk delete completed tasks and the developer said they have no plan to 
implement that?! Finally gave up waiting for the app to grow up.",Negative,0
1533,"I LOOOVE this app! It would give 5 stars, if only it would work😦. It's 
been bad for crashing for months, but I put up with it because I use it so 
much. With the last update thigh, it's even worse. I can't put the widget 
on my phone, it crashes everytime I try, it doesn't give me my reminders 
and crashes half the time I try to use it! Please fix and I'll give 5 
stars!!!",Negative,0
1534,"This application does not pull or push to your Google Tasks you have to use 
tictic third party service product on all your devices in order for it to 
work. I want my money back because when I installed it during the trial it 
seemed to pull my tasks across but now they're saying it doesn't do Google 
Tasks",Positive,1
1535,"Not a good replacement of wunderlist. Free version of this app wont let you 
add description to your task and you have limited categories. If migrate 
from Wunderlist to tick tick and you have lots of categories, tick tick 
will immediately ask you to subscribe to thier plan.",Positive,1
1536,I find it not user friendly.,Positive,1
1537,"I used to love this app but, like most apps on Android, it's gotten 
progressively worse. Now I try to add something to my list by clicking the 
+ button, then I type something in, then I hit the send button, then it 
looks like it's doing something useful, then nothing happens. I've looked 
and I don't see any setting that I'm screwing up or anything and the 
default functionality of the to do list probably shouldn't require you to 
change something for something to show up anyway. Glad I tried this before 
renewing my premium. I'll go find another app.",Positive,1
1538,I hate when you say that it's such a great app and I download it only to find out that you only get the bare basics for something that is advised as FREE. I could only view one week and the rest of the features were extremely limited as well. Waste of time.,Positive,1
1539,29e a year for premium is pushing it way too far,Negative,0
1540,Big fan of gtasks thought I'd give tick tick a try. App stops working constantly and has to be restarted. Can't find the lists I've made in ticktick and my gtasks have disappeared from phoneand can only be accessed through gmail desktop. Will not be renewing the monthly subscription.,Negative,0
1541,If the upgrade free it's well was best.,Positive,1
1542,A kinda like it. Havent used it for long but I'll comeback to review,Positive,1
1543,17.10.2020. Have nested multi level sub task. But not easy to add it. Have to open a task and got the menu to add one. Adding Sub task is easier in apps like My Life Organized or Dynalist. MLO dont have a web version. Dynalist dont have reminder if i am not wrong.,Positive,1
1544,Tiktik was the best. But the last 2 version is not good at all. The text of Havit prompt is very large although I set the text in small. And recently the remainder time is showing in the notification panel as an alerm icon of the default alerm app's icon . Please fix it.,Positive,1
1545,所提供的功能都很不錯，但UI/UX還需加強，希望能簡化一些設置步驟,Negative,0
1546,It is very useful in your daily life. It helps u to set reminders of everything .,Positive,1
1547,"The Pomo section of this app, though a great item, still malfunctions at times. When its set, sometimes even though the Pomo time set is not complete, it closes by itself and shows ""complete"" and gives option to relax. Also, it vanishes after some minutes from the notification. Even though I've removed all battery saving options on tick tick and also given it permission to autostart and run in background, this Pomo function still keeps malfunctioning. Kindly fix this issue. I use a Redmi.",Positive,1
1548,Great app but for months the auto sync on collaborative lists is broken as of a recent update. They still haven't fixed it. Confirmed on several devices,Positive,1

1559,What a pity to finally found wunderlist alternative app. However I can't use this beautiful design app because there is no notification for all the activities in any sharing list except directly mentioned that person name. How to mention everyone name in every comment. Come on dev. You can do such a great job so far. This is just a setting to receive notification. Receive all or just for be mentioned. Wunderlist becomes the best because of user feedback. Don't let the world down 🤣,Positive,1
1560,Is ok however you cannot download older versions for the mac. This quite annoying have to work with web version or buy a new mac. So much for sustainability.,Negative,0
1561,App is good but habit notification doesn't make any sound,Positive,1
1562,The free version does just about enough for my requirements but no more; limited sharing and reminders are less than generous but it works well enough.,Positive,1
1563,Lots to like but Inbox doesn't work as expected: adding dates to tasks does NOT remove them from Inbox so all your tasks stay in Inbox and it's impossible to organize. Please fix! This conflicts with your support site guide,Positive,1
1564,i don't know why the stick notifications not working i have been checked my all settings but i could not find what's the problem..,Negative,0
1565,Sync could use real work. Needs a manual option for when working with multiple devices. Other cloud services can be seen to work immediately on a second device. There's zero settings for synchronization.,Negative,0

1567,Not as smooth as I hoped,Positive,1
1568,"Some good features but overall mediocre compared to my old Wunderlist. If someone shares a list with me I cannot easily join the list. The list is not auto synced with my profile.

1596,"Calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky. Can't see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists. Organize view can't use custom lists to plan my week. The sync with Google is unforgivably poor. If I change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in TickTick. This is so bad I have begun looking for replacement.

1618,Very helpful with lots of features. I would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though. Also it would be delightful if we could add tasks (like the notification) with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up! But still nothing I would pay annually though..,Positive,1

1623,I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported. However some key things I truly miss. Push notifications when someone texts within the app. Notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list. Copy and paste everything I need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list.,Positive,1

1697,It's amazing ok I was really happy with the ability to create list and then a task and furthermore a subtask with a customizable reminder for each However the problem start there when you turn off the pop-up notification and only rely on the regular notification panel it just shows the the subtask name with no additional infos of the main task or the list not even the tag or the customized color is included with it I really sometimes find it difficult to identify the subtask hopefully you fix it,Positive,1

1704,Actually like the new pomodoro statistics update but the bar chart has a flaw. I can't see the exact number of hours but rather an estimate because the exact hours aren't written onto the days like they were before. It'd be great if you could fix that otherwise love it.,Positive,1
1705,It is truly amazing app for productivity. I wish to give 5 star but many features are not available in the free version that's the reason I'm giving 4star.,Positive,1
1706,"I'm a ""to-do"" list kinda person, I rely pretty heavily on them because my memory is 👎 I like that this syncs with my Google calendar. I also like the satisfying little sound when I check a little box to mark a task complete (what can I say? It's the simple things in life 💁‍♀️). I especially like that I can schedule tasks and reminders waaaaay the heck ahead of time.

1756,It's really good app... I have been using it for few days... Really helpful... Just one thing... When I add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks... Can I change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom? That's why given 4 stars...,Positive,1
1757,Good,Positive,1
1758,I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.,Positive,1
1759,It is a nice app and really helps me manage my tasks especially study tasks....it should also include features like sharing schedule with friends .,Positive,1

1866,"Since joining their very affordable monthly subscription, I've found TickTick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine, and it's actually helping me be more productive even though I'm a pretty begrudging procrastinator. First off, the widgets. God, I love the widgets! The first thing I see after unlocking my phone is A) a list of all the stuff I need to be doing on that given day; and B) a cute visual checklist of daily habits that I need to also make time for. This was what I found was missing back when I used the ToDoIst app, was a simple means of having both habits and to-dos living in the same shared ecosystem. I suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features, but what's here is perfectly functional, and easily integrates into your regular 'inbox'/'today' lists. The widgets update dynamically, right along with the full-screen app, and also with the PC and web integrations. This was a ""must-have"" feature, because I've tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget, and seeing them ""refreshed"" into existence several minutes later in the app itself. TickTick makes everything instant, to the point that a TickTick notification 'pings' on my phone at the precise moment it also 'pings' on my laptop. I really can't understate how useful the widget and cross-platform integration is, because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what I'm meant to be doing at any random moment, it's so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important tasks/habits slap me in the face, demanding my attention. This also ties in nicely with the way notifications/alerts work. I've got reminders set on all my habits, and when the reminders go off, they actually ""take over"" the entire screen, at which point I can tick them off, or dig into the more extensive options on the back-end. There's a few areas I can see for quality-of-life improvements, though I'm optimistic that their subscription model means we haven't seen the ""final"" iteration of this app for some time yet. A few things that jump out at me over a couple months' usage: -- To mark a habit as ""incomplete"", you can't just double-tap the checkbox for an 'X' mark, you have to open the app, pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard, go into its settings, and the option is buried all the way in the app's back-end menus. It's a minor gripe, but when compounded over weeks or months of use, it's easy to just not bother marking your ""failures"" at all. It makes me wonder if there's other useful features I've missed just because they're not readily accessible on the front end UI + widgets. -- It would be nice if habits displayed in the widget + front-end UI had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on ""streak"" for. You can track those metrics, but again it's hidden in the robust-yet-opaque back-end, accessible via sub-menus and abstract graphs, rather than being loudly displayed front-and-centre. I'd probably be more motivated to ""keep the streak going"" with a given habit if I could see at a split-second glance how today's efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days, or whatever. --Also, you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week, or a certain number of times per week, but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if you're on track or falling behind. By which I mean, when I pull up my habits for Thursdayy, for instance, and I see ""exercise at gym"" in my list of habits for that day, then surely I should get some indication of ""you've been to the gym X times this week so far, and you have Y gym sessions remaining for this week [in order to fulfil your habitual obligations]"". Again, the information is there in the app, but you have to actively seek it out. Maybe the more fastidious time-keepers will see to this without batting an eye, but for forgetful, ADHD-prone types like myself, if it's not right in front of me then it might as well not exist. But all in all, these are minor foibles. Fantastic app. 5/5.",Positive,1

1952,Too many errors,Negative,0
1953,Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.,Negative,0

1960,I was looking forward to using this app. But it wont even let me pick out an avatar. Things just go blank on the app and tells me I'm missing information when I clearly am not. What a bummer,Positive,1
1961,App has many bugs. 1. Start screen doesn't display first 3 slides. User creating is totally not functional. I'm using both Android 9 and Android 10 same bugs.,Positive,1
1962,"The first 2 slides are black and I can't see character in the character creation. Some message saying ""path 'profile' required habitica...i hope this gets fix soon. Until then I I'll wait.",Positive,1
1963,Wont let me change my appearance so I'm stuck as a black female. The user interface is very poorly designed,Negative,0
1964,Completely unusable on Android right now. Everything is blank or not loading. Downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something I'd be really interested in.,Positive,1
1965,The app is broken right now. Downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank. Character creation is all blank. Unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying. This has been catalogued by others. When its fixed I'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iPhone users. (I have a Samsung S9),Negative,0
1966,"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices. It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken. I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back.",Negative,0
1967,Installed it and it glitched and didn't display many of the images on the 'create your avatar' page. Immediately Uninstalled.,Positive,1
1968,Quite disappointed with this app. Is used to be fine for past years. Currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times. This app need improvement on the server and at times server down :(.,Negative,0
1969,Doesnt work the main screen is stuck i can move to the next page.,Negative,0
1970,Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.,Negative,0
1971,Path profile name is required glitch when trying to make avatar on Galaxy s10,Negative,0
1972,"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality.",Positive,1
1973,App didn't work at all. Was buggy from the start of my sign up where I used my Google account to login.,Negative,0
1974,Want to like it. So far half of the set up items aren't even showing up for my samsung s8. All the purple screens are blank. Was excited to try but it doesn't work.,Positive,1
1975,The website works but the app is blank.,Negative,0
1976,This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.,Negative,0
1977,It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.,Negative,0

1984,Downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits. Gave up after 10 mins.,Positive,1
1985,You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.,Negative,0

1991,Awful graphics. Idea ia great but the graphics need a major update. Can't tell the different between anything in this game. Overall disappointed.,Negative,0
1992,I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR A GAMIFIED PRODUCTIVITY APP. MY REVIEW OF YOURS WHICH IS VERY LACKING: Dark theme is missing! This one appears to be for 5 year olds! Can you make a NON-CHILD app similar to this but for REGULAR PEOPLE not 5 year old RPG gamers? I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.,Negative,0
1993,Good app but i can't do anything since To days ago ! Help me please your app je very usefull for me,Positive,1
1994,Wouldn't even let me customize.,Negative,0
1995,The customization screen at the beginning of set-up doesn't work. Tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it.,Positive,1
1996,Won't let me customize my avatar except for glasses.,Negative,0
1997,Uninstalled. Still cannot remove background to blank. Edit: Yep still the same. Also please put the free backgrounds at the top. This is from only within the app by the way.,Positive,1

1999,"Doesn't work. Nothing happens when signing in with Google and when creating a new account, it just shows ""server timeout"".",Positive,1
2000,Terrible moderator community. Anti religious.  Reply: I've already had numerous interactions with Habatica mods and I've no desire to reply further. When I questioned why the website had an anti-Christian stance I was banned. Nothing more needs to be said.,Negative,0
2001,"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password.",Negative,0
2002,Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...,Positive,1
2003,got banned for talking about not politically correct stuff in a respectful manner. didnt even had a chance to discuss or clear my name. would not recommend bc of it being heavily monitored and censored. it does not facilitate what it was aiming for a community for learning and growth. after pouring 2 months and money into it was terribly disappointed after my ban. yes perma ban. no warnings no nothing. disgusting. outsourcing will power is a bad idea anyways.,Negative,0
2004,confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.,Positive,1

2013,because of not available in my country !,Negative,0
2014,so many bugs..enum not defined exceptions,Negative,0
2015,I couldnt even get past setting everything up before it glitched. I couldnt move on from types of goals. A pop up showed up that said something about strength and attributes.,Positive,1
2016,No i don't feel like getting weapons to hurt someone,Negative,0
2017,the big problem is that task management should work offline and habitica should have synchronization feature like anki mobile and anki pc.,Negative,0
2018,I love it at first plus the very idea gamifying a task to make it a habit. It was all fun until the 'I cant use it offline' that really threw me off. Please make it available offline as well.,Positive,1
2019,"You have to register to ""play"". You can't even check it out to decide if it's worth it.",Positive,1

2023,can't change class.,Negative,0
2024,I cancelled my subscription back in June of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission. I would like a refund for the months between now and then and (another) confirmation that my subscription is cancelled.,Negative,0

2027,Just installed. Keyed in all tasks n to-do list. Server error. Lost everything. Redo. Server error. Lost. Kept repeating. Frustrating = Uninstalled.,Negative,0
2028,I downloaded this app because I thought that the game concept for to-do lists would be really cool. Opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in. Waited another hour and it still wasn't working. Call me impatient but I just couldn't use an app that refused to work.,Negative,0
2029,Constant connection drop outs. Will update review when this is fixed.,Negative,0
2030,Why do you need personal information?? Deleted.,Negative,0
2031,Hate it,Negative,0
2032,its not like Loop Habits where i know i completed my habit this day. where are the statistics? give me the graphics,Positive,1
2033,More like: how to gain dopamine for being organized. Not helpful.,Positive,1
2034,This app is bullocks.I downloaded it and it ran smoothly on my phone and i setup my avatar my habits and my daily task and then it just stopped working and couldn't open the app again!,Negative,0
2035,Graphics are suck,Negative,0
2036,"I really wanted to love this app. It looks amazing & has so much potential. However, the app does not sync to your timezone. My day does not reset at midnight, despite what the app says. When I try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone, it keeps switching back to midnight. So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day. Makes it impossible to effectively use. :(",Positive,1
2037,Have to register,Negative,0

2039,server issues please fix will change review when it's fixed,Positive,1
2040,It doesn't work. Worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it can't connect to the server,Positive,1
2041,Requires being online to use. Which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated. Would use if it didn't require constant network or wifi connection (I live and work in rural areas) . Had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day.,Positive,1
2042,Uninstalled. Couldn't get it to register. Disappointed,Negative,0
2043,Need to work offline,Negative,0

2047,Useless,Negative,0
2048,Does not work,Negative,0

2055,Great app but I uninstalled it because I'm an offline user I wish if you can make it offline with all the functions.,Positive,1
2056,I'm trying to change the language but always stay in english...,Negative,0
2057,"Interesting concept, but the reward tiers are way too steep for beginners. You have to be using this app either constantly, or for a long time, in order to gain decent ""rewards."" Uninstalling, it's just taking up space on my phone at this point and I'm not really motivated to use it.",Positive,1
2058,Every 2 days it erases my goal list and my reward list for several hours then my lists reappear later.,Positive,1
2059,Asking to register right away without trying out the app is poor experience.,Positive,1
2060,"It's good and all but I lost ALL my progress when I reset my phone. I logged into it with my email as I did before then it flashed ""HELLO NEW PLAYER"" cmon man, help me bring up my old account back",Positive,1
2061,It won't load my to-do's which is an important aspect. Fix it please!!!,Positive,1
2062,Yo how to turn off justin?? He pops up nonstop,Negative,0
2063,The app is so good but it's completely destroyed by the fact that it's online for most things as far as i know you need internet and the point is that you can use this even when it's offline i hope they fix it after that it deserves all 5 stars,Positive,1
2064,"Not for couples or friends. Subscription for ""teams"" to share tasks. Doesn't think money from their micro transactions shop is enough.",Positive,1
2065,I tried buying gems but it doesn't look like I got the gems.... But my balance in the Google pay thing has gone down. Last time I throw away money on this app. Update: the gems showed up the following day. Not sure if that's because I emailed them about it or just it took several hours to go through.,Positive,1
2066,The app itself is useful but they charged me three times for one subscription and will not respond to me when I email them.,Positive,1
2067,I keep running into problematic bugs right away,Negative,0
2068,No good as other applications but good for games and one task or goal like da daily routines work,Positive,1
2069,fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.,Positive,1
2070,Make a go back button,Negative,0
2071,"Was ok until i saw the mtx. I guess it truely does ""gamify"" things now.",Positive,1
2072,"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.",Positive,1
2073,Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.,Negative,0
2074,"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",Positive,1
2075,I love the idea but it's not working on my Samsung S10e. Like the main screen is just purple when I first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options. I'll happily try again once bugs are worked out. Keep us posted!,Positive,1
2076,Galaxy S10 on Android 10. FTUE is busted. First two slides don't load. You get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisible/don't display. Please fix or mark the app as incompatible with Android 10.,Positive,1
2077,Not very user friendly and very less interactive,Positive,1
2078,Certain pages don't fit on screen.,Positive,1
2079,"Would you quit directing me to the website!? If I want to join a party/guild it should be done on the app. It won't let me log in on the site AT ALL.. Why you people would choose to have it so if you use ""log in using Google"", it resets and begins a whole new account without asking, now I have two accounts on one email? It won't even give me my password! I tried resetting it several times. How annoying, bad design. After I spent so much time on the app too, all for it not to work",Negative,0
2080,"Seems to have glitched out on me. When I put in my username and display name, it gave me an error saying ""Path Profile.Name Required."" Then none of the Avatar customization options appeared. I wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed. Reopening the app took me to the Dailies tutorial and now I'm sure I'm missing something. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.",Negative,0
2081,I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.,Positive,1
2082,Why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server? I can't open the app and refresh it at all.,Negative,0
2083,Good ideas but not well implemented. It gets tedious and boring after a while.,Positive,1
2084,good app but skills glitch out all the time.....fix this for 5 stars,Positive,1
2085,Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.,Negative,0
2086,"it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for ""unallocated stat points"" anymore",Positive,1
2087,Please make it work offline!!,Positive,1
2088,It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.,Positive,1
2089,Downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best. This was one of the worst. Played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out.,Positive,1
2090,I really enjoyed this app but now if I delete a daily reminder I still get the notification for it! Which is highly annoying! Please fix this it distracts me from my work each time I here my notification go off for a deleted reminder,Positive,1
2091,Can't check of checklist items,Negative,0
2092,Super super buggy on my Note 8 . Can't press anything on the character creation menu after registering . Justin ( the tip guy ) ALWAYS comes up after pressing any of the menus . Super super annoying . please fix a.s.a.p,Positive,1
2093,Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?,Positive,1
2094,Change of days in app is a major problem. I wish it would happen smoothly.,Negative,0
2095,lost the ability to sort to dos by tags. very inconvenient. i used that feature a lot.,Negative,0
2096,It's slow. It'll be better if it works offline,Positive,1
2097,it got boring fast,Negative,0
2098,I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it. I have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working. I have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained. I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.,Positive,1
2099,"Interesting concept but I get a ""path type is required"" error all the time so I stopped using it",Negative,0
2100,requires an account,Negative,0
2101,used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.,Negative,0
2102,it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.,Positive,1
2103,"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!",Positive,1
2104,"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me.",Negative,0
2105,"I couldn't get past the set-up. ""'strength is not valid enum value path 'attitude'""",Positive,1
2106,two stars bc i have adhd AND i REALLY wanted it to work. it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out. I'll try again later.... maybe this fall?,Positive,1
2107,It's completely a mess. Can't understand what to do and where.,Negative,0
2108,Couldn't get past registration/login. I've never used the app before but when I tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when I went to login it just kept loading forever.,Negative,0
2109,Not really interesting. Doesn't help if you don't have a discipline already in place.,Positive,1
2110,Too hard,Negative,0
2111,The dailies and habits should reset everyday.please let them reset,Positive,1
2112,Can do better very complex to handle for newbies.,Positive,1

2114,would like to change my my class and chat is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate. a simple notification system would make it easy.,Positive,1
2115,this app is closing down everytime I try to do anything but daily tasks. rather frustrating...,Negative,0
2116,Not user-friendly,Positive,1
2117,It's been really helpful for habit building but it's now bugging like crazy and crashing every time I open it so not wonderful.,Positive,1
2118,"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely. I went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere. The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always...",Negative,0
2119,Heres the thing. I love this app and the idea behind it. But for some reason its so dang glitchy. Pages wont always change when i scroll. Tasks dont refresh. I often have to completely close the app. Help! Very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out.,Positive,1
2120,"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app...",Positive,1
2121,this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the editting/customizing functions of the other to-do-list apps out there. i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deleted/archived/completed items. be able to choose colors etc ..,Positive,1
2122,the app is awesome. but it made my phone drain 30% battery per day in the background which makes it useless,Positive,1
2123,Very buggy and doesn't always show whole pages or lists.,Negative,0

2125,Clunky and very slow to load. Not fun at all - just yet another task I had to deal with daily.,Positive,1
2126,The app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies. Going back to using just the website now until this is fixed.,Negative,0
2127,Good concept but lack basic functionality,Positive,1
2128,The app itself is quite good but without offline mode it's useless for me.,Positive,1
2129,Doesn't connect at all. Pls fix it,Positive,1
2130,This app seemed very interesting until I got into the app and at the very start of it it made itself very clear that this app is geared towards women. The avatar customization part all the hair and accessories were for women. App seemed cool but unwelcoming for guys.,Positive,1
2131,"Google login does not work for me. In freshly instead app I can tap login 
with google button, pop-up asks me to pick a google account to use, Ipick 
the only one, and I'm left on an empty login /register screen. Really 
tapping google login button does nothing. I've tried: * Manually enabling 
phone and storage permissions * Manually clearing app data and cache * 
Reinstalling the app Nothing worked.",Negative,0
2132,"Thought it was great... until I opened the app to mark off a task only to 
find that I had died. Lost all my progress, no idea how. What is the point 
of having an app that gives you experience when you accomplish goals if you 
can lose it all without knowing why?",Positive,1

2138,Doesn't work,Negative,0
2139,"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",Positive,1
2140,"A fine app, except for all the bugs. Any cosmetic aspirations you were 
hoping to have as a motivator (character customization, equipment, colors 
and more) all do not display. Not only that but an error message pops up 
every time I perform an action. Really hope they patch the bugs. I dare not 
use anything else than the checklist.",Positive,1
2141,"I really used to love this app but mobile push notifications stopped 
working, there's been a ton of bugs lately, and it's just not motivating

in a year or so",Positive,1
2142,"Samsung note8 was unable to get past the ""what tasks would you like to work 
on?"" Screen the next screen selection was blocked out no matter was 
selected or un selected. However the back button still worked",Positive,1
2143,"It's a gamified checklist, which is a good start, But ultimately not enough 
to follow through on the core idea. There's no actual game here, nothing to 
do, and no true incentive to keep you coming back. An upsetting amount of 
content is gated behind purchases and I found my interest waning once I ran 
out of things to look forward to. Also, the fact that it takes until Level 
10 to be allowed to switch classes is insane.",Negative,0
2144,"Honestly, it's kind of dull compared to the web version. You should add 
more colors, because the current interface is kind of bland. I cheat with 
the mobile version but stay focused on the web. Needs some more effort and 
work being done. The greatest thing about this is the parties, and I love 
that you can use accounts, but the android platform seems a bit inferior to 
the web version. Still like it , though. Has some opportunity. EDIT: 
horrible on Android. Trash. Absolutely trash. Great on web, incompetent on 
mobile.",Positive,1

2146,"I was able to set up my account just fine, but I apparently made the mistake of resetting the tutorial to better understand the UI. I kept getting the same ""welcome! Here's what you can do with the app!"" tutorial. Eventually it started to hang, so I got fed up and uninstalled. The UI looks nice, but that doesn't mean it's usable. I had a hard time figuring out the differences between the different areas to set up things you want to improve on. The terminology isn't understandable (no clue as to what separates Habits from Dailies from Tasks), and unfortunately, because I still couldn't understand what I was supposed to do and where, it's not very usable for me. The bug that left me in tutorial/hanging hell was enough. I had it installed got a grand total of 10 minutes, and I don't have the patience to wait out however long it'll take the developer to fix it.  Phone: Google Pixel. Latest version of Android as of 17 March.",Positive,1
2147,"I really really want to like this app.  I can get as far as setting up and tracking tasks, which is awesome. But as soon as I try to form a party and battle monsters, it runs up against some issue with Google authentication (I think) and I can't go any farther. I even tried to delete my account and start over, but when you get to the step were it says ""type delete in all caps""... there is no keyboard or place to type.

2150,Aeesome concept but very buggy and laggy. Won't register my taps in some places. It skipped my tutorial because it wouldn't register my taps to continue.,Negative,0
2151,The bugs are annoying and keep it from being a better app Update: still has way too many bugs that never get fixed. Downgrading from 3 to 2 stars,Positive,1
2152,The idea is great but the design is cumbersome and counter intuitive. I bought gems but was unable to set up challenges due to a bug in the app.,Positive,1

2154,Yeah.. Too many bugs.,Positive,1
2155,This app has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out. The iOS version is a lot better.,Positive,1
2156,I keep tapping and it's just unresponsive. It seems like a fun app but to keep tapping and not getting anywhere is annoying It just stops... Please fix seems like a fun app to try out,Positive,1

2158,There are too much connection errors and bugs and they are really annoying. Please fix it.,Negative,0
2159,it's absolutely fine but can be a bit laggy/temperamental,Positive,1
2160,"I love the layout, structure and simplicity of this app. But it has one critical failure There is no way to view stats except how many times you have done a thing. ""Make the bed"" 23 times. In what timeframe? A month? A year? What is the percentage of days it has been made/not made? The only thing I feel like I have to show for this is virtual items. If you would add satisfaction with good stats I would rate 5/5! Kindest regards William",Positive,1
2161,"I love the concept a lot but the actual ""gaming"" aspect of it leaves a lot to be desired. If there was something we could do or level up to or actually fight. Maybe pokemon sort of format for the game. That would really make it better and keep someone interested",Positive,1

2165,didnt work out for me,Negative,0
2166,"The idea is wonderful, truly. But problems exist:
1) Bugs: to-do list, and dailies keep being empty. Refreshing doesn't work, only close and reopen app.
2) Monthly subscription seems highly excessive - I don't like paying for a service that remains static. This could, and should IMO, be an offline app. Particularly with the existing obvious bugs, payment is out of the question right now.
3) Tutorial is lacking: I had to figure a few things out by myself as a first time user.",Positive,1

2178,It is a pretty good concept it's just not for me,Positive,1
2179,I can't delete tasks from the old challenge anymore,Positive,1
2180,Good app was finding it useful but it's not made clear how you join the guilds or when your reg for a challenge has been ac epted no space to write diary so how do you know people actually were if there was a section for diary overall I found the app very confusing,Positive,1
2181,This app seems to make me want to procrastinate more?,Positive,1
2182,This app has a fantastic concept that being an MMO style game based around your success in real life. The game is entirely server based and I have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect. I would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game. So because of the insane amount of server issues I have experienced just using the app for a little but I could not recommend this which is a shame.,Positive,1

2184,I'm constantly finding little glitches in the game that throw off what I am trying to do when I am trying to earn points. Thank goodness for husband and siblings who have played this enough to know how to fix things when they go buggy but I don't appreciate not being able to go to customer service or send a quick email to help them update the system and fix it.,Positive,1
2185,Just downloaded the app better review later on,Positive,1
2186,Looks promising but I can't create avatar due to this error: path 'profile name' is required.,Positive,1
2187,Is there any ways to see your progress in graphic? Like daily task you've done and see it in graphic stats or something? Because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something? I wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily. The UI and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev,Positive,1
2188,I like the app and it's a pity that I won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which I need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes,Negative,0
2189,Looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone. I can't stand any app that's mostly bright b white. Went with LifeRPG instead.,Negative,0
2190,I really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs. The first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too. After updating the app it was still the same. (Im using a samsung s8 if thats important) Hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app.,Positive,1
2191,It doesn't work offline and when I'm actually online I need also a vpn to use it :-(,Negative,0
2192,The to do list should allow prioritizing tasks by importance and urgency. It would be great if you could add that.,Positive,1
2193,It seems so cool and I wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in. It takes 1second to load and then nothing happens,Positive,1

2196,All my tasks are gone and unable to load anything.,Negative,0
2197,The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.,Positive,1

2199,Why it is not giving me notifications for dailies?,Positive,1
2200,Fantastic idea!!! I've actively been seeking something just like this for a long time. But the app itself is super glitchy. Most things wont load and everything keeps resetting. It might be my connection or my phone. I'm not sure. Hoping I can figure it out cause I love this!,Positive,1

2202,I like this app but this is the buggiest app i ever had i been using this for years and still havent fix them,Positive,1
2203,Love this app. Its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating. I've been more motivated since using it. But I'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my OCD insane. I try to move a task in my list... Only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere I didn't tell it to go. I try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all.,Positive,1
2204,I love it. But the app keeps crashing when I try to invite friends to party and I can't buy gems.,Positive,1
2205,Force closes when trying to create challenge,Positive,1
2206,It miss my data after updating.i can't use it easily.,Positive,1
2207,The app is great except for being internet dependant and lacking an undo button or a button lock for unintended log entries I know there is an edit your character section but there is no record of past entries to use as reference,Positive,1
2208,Its a very good game and I like it but to buy most things in the game you have to get gems or a subscription which you both to pay for. Also I don't seem to get anything when I purchase the enchanted Armoire.,Positive,1

2213,Good idea but this isn't for me. I am much more for classic habit apps.,Positive,1
2214,I really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesn't work offline so I can't use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features.,Positive,1
2215,I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.,Positive,1
2216,I'd love to see class selection. as an option when you start the game. I was forced to be warrior without an option to change. I even went to setting and nothing there to change it either...,Positive,1
2217,I love this app but the latest update is buggy and does not record when I check off tasks. Please fix!,Positive,1
2218,a great app! has some kinks that need ironing and I'll update when they're done. But I love this app and use it daily - as intended 😊,Positive,1

2225,Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.,Positive,1
2226,fun way to track habits. It would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers,Positive,1

2237,I love those platform but the recent update is buggy,Positive,1
2238,Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. Most notifications don't work for me. The redesign looks really nice!,Positive,1

2240,I love that's application but l Will to be in spanish version I love that's application but l Will be like to be in spanish version,Positive,1
2241,I really enjoy the app and it helps in keeping up with the goals. Congrats to the team Habitica for this creation. I'm rating it 4 because there are still bugs exists and I'm not satisfied with the idea of 'only team leader can end a quest in order to for someone to leave the party'. I was invited to a party by a friend and then he stopped using it when we grew apart which made me trapped in the party not able to finish a quest. I had to delete my account and restart for keep going. :(,Positive,1

2245,Really fun and keeps you working on day to day tasks.,Positive,1

2253,App is pretty good but everytime I add an item to my to-do list or habits etc it goes back to the party tab. So annoying to go back to tasks every time I add something,Positive,1
2254,This app has actually really made a difference in my life. I am so grateful BUT I feel it could be WAY better. Can you add in: A Timer (for workouts) and perhaps Minigames?? (The higher level your character the more powerful stuff like that 😀😀) Thank you devs!,Positive,1
2255,Cute app. Could do with a more user-easy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator,Positive,1

2261,it has very very few bugs in the mobile app but i love it!,Positive,1
2262,This app is really cool and can help build many habits and keep track of to do lists. However I would like options to customizer the avatar more? Like I accidentally added glasses and there isn't a option for none. Can you please add it?,Positive,1
2263,This app actually made me want to stick to my habits. The money/exp system is kind of broken and arbitrary. Fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it.,Positive,1

2270,The auto populated list of dailies was never-ending and repetitive. Who needs to floss 30 times a day? I died because i didn't take the time to delete each one individually. Honestly when i scrolled down to try to find the end i couldn't find it and felt i was making no progress in deleting the duplicates.,Positive,1
2271,Such a thoughtful self-help app. Life saving for ADHD. THANK YOU for the wheelchair option in the icon... the diversity was such a nice surprise. I do wish there were different task layouts to choose from for the front page -- I'm just easily confused I guess! Thank you staff.,Positive,1
2272,It's a good app.,Positive,1
2273,It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thanks so much,Positive,1
2274,It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.,Positive,1

2279,Great for ADHD,Positive,1
2280,Could be better if it was completely free.,Positive,1
2281,The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.,Positive,1
2282,Best app for daily Routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings. You should improve that because Some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level.,Positive,1
2283,Pretty good app that helps me stay organized. Could use a few improvements but overall I enjoy it,Positive,1
2284,Habitica is awesome! Only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app.,Positive,1
2285,Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward,Positive,1
2286,This app is good and it's useful. Yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and I like it. I wish it had an offline mode because I can't stay on all the time but I can see why we need to be online at all times.,Positive,1
2287,Very cool app!,Positive,1
2288,The app is good and all. The only problem is that the reminder does not work.,Positive,1
2289,So far I love it,Positive,1
2290,Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.,Positive,1
2291,"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.",Positive,1
2292,I wish I could control the reminders for my tasks more. Like the volume or what noise it makes. Other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done.,Positive,1
2293,Such a cool app! I'm in love with it! Sad that it doesn't work properly offline though :( also has bugs,Positive,1

2297,Quite confusing,Negative,0
2298,Nice but why does it need data tho?,Positive,1

2302,Great app!,Positive,1

2304,"Perfect app!.... but its missing an IMPORTANT tab... its already got Habits, Dailies and To-Do's BUT it doesn't have a Bucket List/Life Goals tab, for me, It doesn't feel right to put ""Learn a new recipe"" in the To-do Tab, I also want to put in my goals like ""focus on getting high grades"" or ""get a girlfriend"", I can't put these in other tabs",Positive,1

2309,"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!",Positive,1

I would be so far ahead! So I thought to look for a Gamification app. Habiticia fit perfectly. I'm using the same ""obsessed"" attitude and all my thousands of hours of childhood ""training"" I have to achieve in video games games for achieving my daily habits. Thank you, you saved me. Instant 1 year sub.",Positive,1
2338,This is one of the best to do lists that I have used . Even Google's to do lists pales on comparison.I was surprised to find no constant ads or a pro mode which these things usually have. The widgets are almost perfect except for the hobbies make that 1x1 but it's a really good experience overall . I recommend using it .

My to-do list doesn't scare me anymore and I no longer deal with crippling anxiety about all the stuff I didn't do every night when I try to sleep. Definitely feels like I've ""hacked"" my reward system. Fingers crossed this isn't just a honeymoon period, because for the first time in ages I'm ENJOYING getting things done.

2392,Best productivity app,Positive,1
2393,"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well.",Positive,1

2405,"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓",Positive,1

2410,Life changing app. If you have any affinity to video games and want to better your life you're in the right place. This app saved me.,Positive,1
2411,Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.,Positive,1
2412,Awesome. It really helps me to level up my life.,Positive,1
2413,A good app. Love the concept. Helped me,Positive,1
2414,This is the first time I found an app which can read my mind. This app really knows the scientific importance of reward. I really advice anyone to install this app and give it a try especially if you are a student.,Positive,1
2415,It is awesome super helped me But I have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them,Positive,1
2416,I've never enjoyed accountability before this... Our whole family partied up and is having a blast PLAYING to do chores. Wonderful concept!,Positive,1
2417,I'm really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow. Downside is the glasses and headband can't come off the avatar. So my character is stuck with them for awhile.,Positive,1
2418,Super helpful for habits and breaking bad ones,Positive,1
2419,"What an absolute boon. My boyfriend has ADHD and a love for video games--this app helps him remember and complete tasks much more easily than unengaging notes-app checklists. It really does wonders for motivation. Habitica is helping me survive grad school AND manage the mental load of day to day activities. I'm really excited for the new ""groups"" feature to be rolled out as well. Thank you so much Habitica!",Positive,1
2420,Loving the app so far! Just a minor note: I can't seem to unequip my avatar's glasses or headband...,Positive,1

2427,Fantastic app.... I have tried many other productivity app and used to find it difficult to follow them every day. After I switched to this app.. it became all fun and I am getting motivated to complete the tasks as I earn rewards Suggestion to developer: I use browser version more than mobile app. please add reminder feature to browser version as well. Also please add auto date parser while adding the task. It will save a lot of time in entering the task. You ca take reference from ticktick app,Positive,1

2435,I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.,Positive,1
2436,I am in the unique circumstance of liking to gamify my life and also being horrible at incentivizing doing daily chores. This is literally the perfect app for me.,Positive,1
2437,This app is really pretty annoying. it said I didn't allow any permissions but it gave absolutely no further instruction. So for a $1.99 I figured what do I have to lose. Well I have a lot of time to lose because I spent the money I now have the premium app I set the timer and I got the same message. It says you have not set permissions but it gives no instruction as to how to set permissions and no button that I click works. If it wasn't too much aggravation I'd be asking for a refund.,Negative,0

You've taken this feature away for most users and kept a few, bland trees, as an obvious tactic to boost purchases, which is annoying. What's even more annoying is the disingenuous replies of ""pirated software"", (09/09/2020 response). Was going to give a 2 or 3 since it's now just an average app, but now a 1",Positive,1

2510,I love this app but after the last update it won't work at all. :(,Positive,1
2511,Not working. Keeps force exit the app.,Negative,0
2512,It doesn't work anymore:(,Negative,0
2513,the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall. this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app. there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them. the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone. edit: there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs don't care. LISTEN TO THE USERS,Positive,1
2514,I already bought this app a year ago. I just got a new phone and it keeps on pushing me to buy premium when I've already bought it. Logging will also push you to buy the premium. I've tried to click Forget Password but it send the email VERY LATE.,Negative,0
2515,It used to be great but ever since it updated it doesn't work and it let's me go onto other apps while in use which defeats the purpose of the app. I was going to upgrade to premium but now that its not working I don't dare risk it if even the basic features don't work then I doubt that the premium ones will.,Negative,0
2516,why did you take away the option to unlock trees with coins? that's dumb. edit: i've read your reply and believe that better services were not provided and operations were not improved,Positive,1
2517,What's the problem!!!!!!! I don't like it coz it always says that the game has stooped u nfortunatelly,Negative,0
2518,Not bad.,Negative,0
2519,"Awesome app, really motivates to ditch the phone but I just purchased premium and the app didn't get updated. It says your payment was cancelled even when the amount is deducted and the bank showed ""payment successful"". Did I just waste my money? Please solve this problem. I have the latest version of the app... it's up to date. I also wrote a mail but there has been no reply till now.",Positive,1
2520,Force closing after recent update on all samsung devices.,Negative,0
2521,Very very bad,Negative,0
2522,Dont know what they did but this app doesnt work on my Android 10 device anymore. Lags for ages then just stops working and shuts down. Not helpful. Now my forest wont grow and will become neglected because I am uninstalling this app next and I doubt I'll ever use it again.,Negative,0
2523,This is worst app....single star dena majboori th...nhi to wo bh n deta....mera premium ke liye 129 rupees pay ho gya aur yha pe premium bh nhi mila....ye log bina login ke payment krate h...to kya proof h ki kisne payment ki.....this is worst app don't pay,Negative,0
2524,I was thinking about buying the pro version when i have the availability of all the trees for the other benefits but at the very end they put all the good trees in pro version kind of forcing me to buy it. That sucks and makes this app good for nothing.,Positive,1
2525,"Hearing other peoples experiences really ruins the app for me. I'm a pro user, I didn't know that all the trees were behind a pay wall now. But to make that change, it's really disappointing. It takes away all the fun, all the hard work people have made to buy trees. And you guys don't care, you just copy and paste the same trashy response. I honestly don't think that putting everything behind a pay wall will ""prevent pirated software"". Won't people want to pirate it more when the fun is gone?",Positive,1

2538,I liked this app this is verry nice aap,Positive,1
2539,Used to be great until they became too pushy to upgrade to the paid version. Now you need to be on the pro version to buy designer trees as compared to the early days where you could just purchase them even on the free version. Quite disappointed with the development team frankly.,Positive,1
2540,I don't know what's go in on cause from yesterday my forest It doesn't work I'm so sad cause I love this app please fix it,Positive,1

2546,I bought premium and reset my phone and I can't get my pro account anymore. Can y'all fix that or something,Negative,0
2547,It was a good app. I made premium purchase yesterday and unknowingly cleared my data today. Now I can't login and asking me to buy again. Please look into this. Many of my friends facing the same issue. Please make login a feature in the app 🥺🥺😭,Positive,1
2548,Why do you lock everything in new updates? I used to love this app but I'm uninstall it,Positive,1
2549,It is useless. Even after planting the tree app does not stop me.,Negative,0
2550,This app does not notify me when the pomodoro is done. I just end up working for an hour or two. Useless.,Negative,0
2551,This used to be a great app but the quality has gone down over time,Positive,1
2552,I found a replacement for you now and I am very happy 😊. It's the study bunny app and has all the features which your pro version has in free . Uninstalling this app .,Positive,1
2553,It's very bad,Negative,0
2554,It doesn't work on multiple devices,Negative,0
2555,It would be 5 star but 1 star for you dammm new update which is purchasing plants😤😤😤,Negative,0
2556,It doesnt guide me back when i leave the app,Negative,0
2557,I used to enjoy this app but with the most recent update I have no more incentive in using this app because there's basically no more trees that k can buy without paying for the pro version. I'll be looking for another app to use instead of this one.,Positive,1
2558,Got much worse after update.. I LOST ALL My paid trees that i had purchased...... i am looted...... return my species,Negative,0
2559,फर्जी,Negative,0
2560,Not able to understand how to use this productive app,Negative,0
2561,I bought the pro version and now I am not able to login again. Everytime it's asking me to sign-up again and for that you have to buy the pro version again. I don't know is this is the problem with the latest update but I am not getting option to login,Negative,0
2562,their should be alarm type sound when we complete some task,Negative,0
2563,Initially it was a very great experience with this app but nowadays the app suddenly gets closed and the tree gets dead.,Negative,0
2564,This program has gotten worse by updating. This is not acceptable,Negative,0
2565,"No real objective, I dont see the difference from a simple timer. The app is still good, but you can't really look at your forest and say ""wow"" and get motivated. I think this app doesnt keep its promises :) Also I have no sound so I dont know when the timer goes off which does not do the job (it works for others people tho).",Positive,1
2566,I think that forest is so good,Positive,1
2567,This app has big issues. It allows other apps to be used even though they have been restricted from use during a tree planting. This is despite blocking those apps in the allow list It kept crushing so I uninstalled it and put it back on. All my progress from when I started planting trees was lost and I use a pro version. One should be able to recover those planted trees surely. After all I'm using the pro version .,Negative,0
2568,Used to like this app alot but now I have less motivation in earning coins since I have to get premium to get the trees i want. 😔 Saw the developer's reply in others' alike review but I hope they make an effort to create trees that compensate the update.,Positive,1
2569,This is good app but very stick app I give 2 star because little little I don't understand this app.,Positive,1
2570,The app keeps hanging . I have to uninstall and then reinstall it once every 3-4 days. Please fix the bug.,Positive,1
2571,Totally a black screen coming when ever we are trying to watch an ad to double up coins plz fix this issue,Positive,1
2572,WE NEED AN ALARM TONE AFTER TIMER ⏲ IS DONE. 📣 (PREMIUM USER) I often went OVER time because I don't notice my tree has already grown. (I turn off the bg music cuz it's distracting for me. I prefer piano music.) The excess time I went over could have been used to grow MORE trees. PLS ADD AN ALARM TONE! Thank you.,Negative,0
2573,Bought premium on one device which worked well. Have recently changed device but am unable to login due to a pop-up asking to pay for premium. *Edit The new device is also android. I ended up rebuying premium,Positive,1
2574,Absolutely loved this app when I first got it. After the new update I'm very disappointed to see that most of the content is locked for non Pro users. I had an entire plan for which trees I still wanted to get and the newest species looks awesome! But now I have to PAY to unlock it? The little trees were my number 1 motivation to use this app and get my work done in the first place... now I can't even do that.,Positive,1
2575,The last update is soooo wrong. I'm losing my hours.,Negative,0
2576,I didn't like it.😐😐,Positive,1
2577,I really liked it at first and one of the main reasons that attract me was. The beautiful trees and now free users can only have limited trees and I don't even like one of them so I'm removing this from my favourite app list. Time to find another one. I'm really disappointed...,Positive,1
2578,It take to much time,Negative,0
2579,I was genuinely considering buying the pro version because I really liked this app but the latest update made a bunch of the trees premium only and I had just saved enough coins to buy another and now I can't get one of the ones I wanted and I'm very angry so now I don't want to anymore.,Positive,1
2580,"This app has definitely helped me put my phone down, but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards. After using it for six months, I've run out of trees and plants to purchase, so there's not much more to ""add"" to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins. When I get a new phone I wasn't able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before.",Positive,1
2581,Helps me focus greatly but I cant connect to my other devices. I bought the app with my iPad but I cant log in through my android phone to access any of the data or my trees,Positive,1
2582,"I used to LOVE this app. It felt really rewarding to have focused long enough to buy a cool new plant you've been saving up for.... Now, those trees are locked behind a ""premium"" wall... they're charging you for content they offered for free before. It seems like they're taking advantage of their users and charging money for an app catered towards helping broke college students study. Seems wrong, especially during such hard economic and social times. I'm a long time user offering 2 stars.",Positive,1
2583,Used to be a good app. Now it is limited. Students don't have that much to pay for every app they use.,Positive,1
2584,Nothing interesting unless you get premium 😕 at least let us buy trees by watching some ads,Negative,0
2585,Used to love the app. They make you give phone access to be in leader boards and buy premium for interesting trees. I understand they are worried about pirated software but they are sacrificing their user base in exchange.,Positive,1
2586,"App is very useful but most fun part - planting trees is annoying. There are very few species available. Even though I bought premium I still need to ""focus"" approximately 4000 minutes just to buy 1 2k tree Another feature I would like to have is arranging my forest as I want. Currently trees appear randomly.",Positive,1
2587,I have been using Forest for a few years now and I have switched to an iPhone 11 now but they are asking me to purchase the app to access it. The app is free on android so should I pay for AppleStore?,Positive,1
2588,App is really good at a time. But after the last few updates you made everything premium. We can't even buy new tree species that looks good. That's boreing to plant same kinda trees everyday . Then what can we do with in game money if we can't buy any of them. What are you trying to do. You will loose too many of users by doing these kinda things. So please do something with this stuff please........ Its a request please reply if you agree..,Positive,1
2589,It keeps closing the app.,Negative,0
2590,Love it but had to leave a review bcz of the policy so that I can get that lovely free plant,Positive,1
2591,What is 599 error??? It just stop me using this app!! Hate that!,Negative,0
2592,It seems your pro app for most android user has error: 600 when they use referral codes for friend invitation. I hope you fix it as soon as you can.,Positive,1
2593,feelings disappointed bcs i paid for nothing. you should've let the premium user get at least 5 or more new trees. it was such a large amount of money just for a tree and some little feature.,Negative,0
2594,The most inconvenience I have faced is that the notification sound is not even audible after the tree has completely planted. This make me even more distracted to keep checking on this. Hope forest will take this issue into serious consideration as I was so disappointed by this bug after I have purchased the pro version.,Negative,0
2595,pay money for tree 🌲 :(,Negative,0
2596,Since the update I am not able to open the store,Negative,0
2597,Cant log in after an uninstall. When i press log in i get a pro pop up. But i already have pro. Just let me log in!!!!! Furthermore it just gives me an error when i try to restore purchase. Incredibly disappointed. Loved the app but now i feel robbed. Please fix,Positive,1
2598,Had this app for about 2 years. I had earned almost 5000 points. I got a new phone and everything I had is gone. I have the same number and my email addresses are all synced.. but none of my earnings or unlocks are here.. I feel sort of reluctant to use it now.,Negative,0
2599,Drain phone battery when not using it,Negative,0
2600,Its good,Positive,1
2601,"Until recent update it was a 5 star. If you bring changes make sure your customer services are reponsive too at that time. The friendship redeem option didnt appear in settings after update, so i reinstalled same device,now i cant restore at all, ""error says sign out of other accounts"" i use only one email and i will not factory reset my phone for one app. Dont go blind over money, I really want to help plant trees, now everything looks like money grab.",Positive,1
2602,This app nothing help in focused because i start this app timer after that i can easily open any app but the timer going on continuosly the tree cannot shrink. Please fix this problem after than this app rate 5 stars.,Negative,0
2603,Even after I've enabled deep focus I can use apps that are not in the allowed list. Sometimes the blocking of apps doesn't work.,Negative,0
2604,Good apps,Positive,1
2605,Good job,Positive,1
2606,Looks cool but i had to uninstall the app because it wont go to sd storage.,Positive,1

2608,Okay,Positive,1
2609,I live in Iran.I can't use the app because of payment problems. 😑😒 I have to uninstall it.,Negative,0
2610,The new update is really disappointing. I was truly enjoying the app and watching my forest grow.,Positive,1
2611,This used to be such a great app... But since the new update we cannot purchase new species of trees... Additional to that the promotional adds have increased. The iOS users aren't paying a single penny extra for anything either pro version or having a group timer even all the species are available. This is not done... You have snatched the mere basic content of the app from Android users.,Positive,1
2612,There is some problem. It no longer gives me warning and redirects me back to forest when I use some other app.,Negative,0
2613,I wish I could set 4 to 5 hours at a time. And I hate those ads popping up whenever I open the app.,Negative,0
2614,Just stay off your phone 😂,Negative,0
2615,I now have a strong dislike for this app. I've had it for a little while now but the fact that I now have to pay for pro for most of the trees is ridiculous. It was fine before. Why do these app developers mess things up like this?,Negative,0
2616,Guys what the hell is pro version.. I collected coins to buy the 2k tree but now I can't 😒m giving u two stars cz I aced in my exam cz of this app.. But the pro version is really disappointing..😢,Negative,0
2617,I request the seekrtech team to please add some tree species to the free version. Please! It is a humble request 😔,Positive,1
2618,Edit: I've had his app for a long time. I was here back when the app whitelist was a free feature. In the latest update the free version is much more limited and free users can't even buy all the trees anymore. It's frustrating to see all the good features of this app being hidden away. I understand new updates like the detailed stats and planting with friends being exclusive to the pro version or making newer trees exclusive but please give the old trees back!,Positive,1
2619,basically if you don't have the pro version you can't use 90% of the app such a good app but you have to pay for each and every new options for studying like pie chart trackers 😒no good,Positive,1
2620,This app is really very good ....but I'm disappointed with the new update.... majority of the tress have been added to the pro version ...I happily updated to see if any new species is added ... I recommended it to many of my friends .... but I'm seriously very disappointed,Positive,1
2621,I realy like this app. Rhe thing is that you only can buy some specific trees and for the others you need the pro version and befor you just can buy more trees.,Positive,1
2622,It say over 25 mil downloads and there are only 10 mil downloads,Negative,0
2623,I hate how I now have to get the Pro version to plant the trees that I like. Maybe give more trees in the free version or give more veriety? The nine free ones don't really give me motivation to finish anything.,Positive,1
2624,Quite disappointed after the recent updates... You are trying to monetize everything... You may end up loosing your worthy and loyal customers by this predatory approach...,Positive,1
2625,"What motivated me to keep using the app was collecting coins to unlock different trees. Now, to unlock must of them, is not enough to collect coins... now you have to have the ""pro"" version! I was earning to get the sunflowers... Why? WHY!? I'll have to found another app. Also, I don't think it's ok to only plant trees in real life only having the pro version :( use ecosia browser instead (not sponsored) and stop monopolizing our planet's health.",Positive,1
2626,I used to love this app but I'm disappointed with the new update that has so limited free tree selection. Please fix that!,Positive,1

2635,I tried a couple of time but still can't install it. I tried other apps and they are ok,Positive,1
2636,I used to love this app and use it always but why have you made all of the special trees only for pro users? I used to continue planting trees to earn coins for new trees but now my coins are for nothing,Positive,1
2637,My app updated and now almost all the tree options are locked behind a pay wall? This is such a disappointment when I've been saving up my coins! Not a fan. Uninstalled.,Negative,0
2638,The latest upgrade is so mean!! You could've added all the upcoming trees for the pro version gradually. But almost all old trees are now for pro. Seriously? :(,Negative,0
2639,Whatttt!??!?? This app is connected to my other account...??? And I'm not able to change it. I can't pay right now for the pro version because it's connected to a different account. How do I solve thisss????? Help!!!!!!! :-| The app is nice and I need the pro version. !?!?!?,Positive,1

2657,It worked properly once later its asking to upgrade and app is not opening Rest the features and everything is good,Positive,1
2658,One more feature should be added with extra is that there should be A timer becoz sometimes some important works comes in middle of the time set by us ..

2708,Very good app for focused working.. the interface n graphic works are very good. No Alarm or Sound notification for session time completion.. that can be easily incorporated in the app but missed.,Positive,1

2714,its above average,Negative,0
2715,I'm quite dissapointed about the new update. I'm a Free user and I bought every Tree using my coins but when I updated it all the trees I spend were gone or it's only available in Pro. Since i can't afford the Pro I'm just dissapointed and sad that I can't unlock my trees unless I'm in Pro. I've been using this app and it was the best but now I'm rating it on 3 stars cause I can't unlock or use I spend in a year. Please help me get my trees back I'm sad right now ;-;,Positive,1
2716,I don't like the new actualization that the app have. I can't buy any other tree unless I pay with real money. I don't know what is the point to earn coins if you can't use them.,Positive,1
2717,It's a good app and was very helpful. However when the app updated it signed me put of my account and apparently I can't restore it. Would be helpful if you could fix this,Positive,1

2733,"Love this app, Pro Version is definitely worth it. However... my referral code would NOT pull up, and I missed an oppurtunity to refer someone. Adding friends and creating a ""Room"" together is way too difficult, and I would also like to see the option to delete tags. Rather difficult to navigate app regarding all these things, but I am hopeful to see what modifications are brought forward.",Positive,1

2754,Hey Forest Team! Seen your progress grow over the years loving the new favorites and tags interface! What would make it better is allowing multitag selections! This is one pomodoro app that doesnt have breaks. Pls add a break timer after each sess. Would be nice under your new UI! No trees would be selected or planted of course! Customized break times can also be added to favs! Thanks & lots of love,Positive,1

2767,it really helped me to get out of my addictions and live a days to its fullest. But ads are the main ⚠️ problem,Negative,0
2768,After completion of planting time it doesn't plays sounds notification. And because of this time exceeds in one task more than one and causes mismanagement! Kindly fix it!,Positive,1
2769,It doesn't let you take a break when you finish your study sessions. I love the app and I've been using it for a long time but the last weeks it doesn't work correctly. I'll come back to it when the issue is fixed.,Positive,1

2778,Really cute app and I love it. But I wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer? Take a short break then resume studying. It'll be really nice. edit: still nice but its boring now not gonna lie. And I find it so unfair that we have to pay again? For a more exquisite tree when we already did? My motivation just drops-,Positive,1

2785,I hope this gives more opportunities for people without pro version as mostly students are using and we can't really afford to pay.....Overall I love this apps and helps me so much :)))),Positive,1
2786,This has been really helpful for me to be more productive. I wish that there were one or two more trees available at the start as this would motivate me more to make my forest look different and I'd spend more time earning more coins. Its a slight incentive but it would work for me. I like the fact that I get the redirect message if I happen to tap on an app that I shouldnt be using.,Positive,1
2787,The App is good but uninstalling coz almost many things are premium. That irritates me,Positive,1

2805,I have premium but thought it would be better if there are more trees available. Since players are able to build their own biome eg. Desert. That would add more fun to the app.,Positive,1

2814,"Love the app. The paid version is 100% worth it. The only thing missing is nested tags. I'd like to be able to tag a tree as ""Study > Econ 101"" for example.",Positive,1
2815,It's a very useful app for the people who wants to concentrate for a big amount of time without checking their phones. I'm a student and I use this app every time that I do my assignments for the day because it helps me to stay focused on what I'm doing.,Positive,1
2816,Good app to focus,Positive,1
2817,I wanna get allow list but can't buy pro version in our country,Positive,1
2818,"I love this app and use it religiously while studying, it is a life saver. I use the app along side the desktop chrome extension and I tend to start both timers at the same time, this messes with my stats and the length of time I have ""stayed focus"" is doubled. I wish there was a way you could chose to limit multiple devices at one time. now I don't know how feasible it is, but it would be really helpful and really add to the experience of using the app!!",Positive,1
2819,So good,Positive,1

2892,Great ! Error 600 trying to invite friends tho..,Positive,1
2893,I really love this app and my friends and I have created a remote study group using it. One suggestion I have is I wish my friends could join into my group study session at any time after they've been invited and just plant a tree for how long the rest of the session lasts. If I am using deep focus I can't communicate with my group about setting up another study session and at what time. It'd be nice if they could just join for the remaining time.,Positive,1

3135,Does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading. Unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me. Do not recommend. Waste of time.,Negative,0
3136,Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application. I've lost all my progress that I've been tracking from 300 days. Shittiest app ever.,Negative,0
3137,Can only track 5 habits at a time,Negative,0
3138,Really liked the app and have been using premium but now I want to transfer to a new device.

3162,"App was good in past but not anymore, it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since.

3163,Not updated anymore. Unstable,Negative,0
3164,NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS.

3170,"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits.""",Positive,1
3171,Premium does not work. False advertising!,Negative,0
3172,How do i get a refund?,Negative,0

3176,After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.,Negative,0
3177,Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive,Positive,1
3178,"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back.

3203,The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.,Negative,0

My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost. There's no way to restore my data or contact the devs. If you cannot save on JSON file of mine in your cloud, please explain why I should buy premium?

3226,Reminders are not on time!,Negative,0
3227,Won't allow me to register or make an account. Tried to set up without on to try it out but as soon as you lose the app the habits you have set up disappear! Not the best trial!,Positive,1
3228,Reminders ain't working!,Negative,0
3229,A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.,Positive,1
3230,Free account limited to 5 habits,Positive,1
3231,Complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest. Atleast widget should be available for trials.,Positive,1

3236,Sync no longer working:(,Negative,0
3237,"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars.",Positive,1
3238,Unable to import any data from the .csv file in cloud!!! No option to get any data back! Bought premium and im not happy. Beware!!!,Positive,1
3239,Loading takes too long and reminders don't work.,Negative,0
3240,The moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired. Needs better moderation.,Positive,1
3241,Sync no longer works. Also app has been buggy lately - closes down and does not respond. I'm now using Loop Habit Tracker which is more stable.,Positive,1
3242,"I've been using this app for more than 5 years, it was great. But currently I changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn't work anymore :( It says something like ""no internet connection"". So at the end I have to use another app.",Positive,1
3243,Mixed great app but don't by premium. Won't work without play services and developer unresponsive,Positive,1
3244,EDIT/UPDATE - Purchased premium. Sync doesn't work. A quick glance at developers FB/Twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth (no activity since 2018). App hasn't received an update since 2018. My suggestion: pick an app that's still actively developed. Exactly what I have been looking for. Fantastic interface and thoughtful design. I'm hooked guys!,Positive,1
3245,The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.,Positive,1
3246,I liked the app until it told me I could only have 5 goals. :(,Positive,1
3247,Only 5 items on free version. Would be nice to have that clear so I don't have to waste my time and give out my email.,Positive,1
3248,Love and use the app BUT sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing.,Positive,1
3249,The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.,Positive,1
3250,I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.,Positive,1
3251,DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,Positive,1
3252,Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.,Positive,1

3259,No notification of Habit tracks,Negative,0
3260,"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium.",Positive,1
3261,Desde hace unos meses no sirve la Sync ni me deja entrar a la cuenta,Negative,0
3262,Cannot sync. What is going on?,Negative,0
3263,The app doesn't really look like the screenshots. It's also quite outdated in design. If you don't mind paying for it then it gets the job done.,Positive,1
3264,please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app😥 i can't live without this feature,Positive,1

3268,good,Positive,1
3269,the app requires premium membership to use the widget. defeats the point for me,Negative,0
3270,I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.,Positive,1

3275,the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free,Positive,1
3276,it's not worth the premium. I tried to get a refund because it wasn't what I thought it would be and no one has contacted me. They claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer. I will be deleting this app and regretting the $8 purchase,Negative,0
3277,There needs to be an option on when the habit starts,Negative,0
3278,Awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of $5 its about $10 for me with tax included. Also I don't appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33% claimed discounted price very deceiving. Lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019.,Positive,1
3279,Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.,Positive,1
3280,"I could not figure out how to set reminders. And I did NOT want to ""register""",Positive,1
3281,I love the ease of the application and the setup. I don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame-based. it doesn't make me want to try any harder when I get scolded for not fulfilling my goals. positive encouragement as the best way.,Positive,1
3282,I want to start my week with Saturday and it is not available! only can change between Sunday & Monday !,Positive,1

3287,Reminders are not working. I have an Asus ZenFone 4 (shouldn't matter) and I have set the reminders multiple times with no success. I feel this is the most important part of this app as I need reminding in order to affectively create a habit. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. My rating my change after feedback.,Positive,1
3288,Two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year. Is this application still supported by the dev team?,Positive,1
3289,I didn't like it.,Positive,1
3290,none of the notifications work. other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix. the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications,Negative,0
3291,I don't like the layout at all. I want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks.,Positive,1
3292,Love the app. Would love a version for Windows/Chrome to use on PC. Also I bought a premium version and now when I opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the non-premium version.,Positive,1
3293,Paid for this years ago and used it on another device. Now I have a new phone and when I'm trying to login it says my email address is not in the database.,Negative,0
3294,It stops sending notifications randomly.,Negative,0
3295,Good concept with poor design. The widget needs a redesign - currently it wastes a lot of space on my homescreen. The forum section is good.,Positive,1
3296,I like the overall app. It is the best. But even after setting the reminder for my habits. I do not receive any notification or reminder. I have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on.,Positive,1
3297,Please don't call me darling! My app reminder called me darling. Not cool!,Positive,1
3298,Works OK on Galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications. Can't even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts. In the end all data lost and so am I.,Negative,0
3299,Free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing,Positive,1
3300,Only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to PAY for more. Always about the money. Sorry I wasted time on setting this up.,Negative,0
3301,"Almost 3 years ago I liked it enough to purchase it. Then they decided to make it a monthly fee. I found this out when I reloaded it onto my phone. I emailed them to find out if my previous purchase was valid or if it was applicable to the new version and they never responded. Even a simple ""no"" would have been fine. So, I found another habit tracker that I actually prefer.",Positive,1
3302,Didn't like it,Positive,1
3303,Lost my premium and all my habits gone when I changed my device. The app was great but doesn't seem good for long term use.,Positive,1
3304,The fact that with the free version doesn't let someone track more than 5 habits it's a shame,Positive,1
3305,Worked for about a day and then just crashed repeatedly so have uninstalled. Disappointed as looked really good,Negative,0
3306,I think it's really petty that the widget only comes with a premium account. No thanks.,Positive,1

Yes, you have to MANUALLY do everything...my time is to valuable to waste 
on this garbage.",Positive,1

so that I can access it on my computer too. EDIT: Like many others, my 
premium account is gone too. I don't mind purchasing it again but what if 
it goes missing again???",Positive,1
3310,"I would give 5. But the reminder is not working. And I wish the app had a 
way to report such bugs. Uninstalled",Positive,1
3311,"I have purchased full version of this app. The functionality of the app is 
good but many features are not working properly. Eg. Starup on Montly view 
is not working. Additionally there is absolutely zero response from the 
developers on reporting the bugs",Positive,1

more than 5 habits to track. Not realistic for me to only need 5. 
Uninstalled it.",Positive,1
3313,"Please help me. I really like this app. But my premium purchase with my 
facebook account is gone. Recently I have trouble with the app. It stops 
everytime I opens. Then I uninstall, and reinstall it again. But it 
continues to stop. It turns out that the problem is I disabled Chrome. 
Because after I installed and update Chrome, the Habit Tracker worms again.

get my premium features anywhere else",Positive,1
3319,Sync isn't working. Lost my data again....,Negative,0
3320,"Sorry for the poor rating but your app has a major bug. Swiping up or down 
while viewing details for a month/habit makes the interface jump to details 
for another habit randomly. It's a pain to realise midway that suddenly you 
are reading incorrect data. Happens so many times that it's not funny. Will 
be looking for alternatives to your app",Negative,0
3321,"Great design except they hide the fact you can track 5 on the free version 
until you go through the process of adding all five individually then you 
find out you can't add anymore without premiuthem, freemium is fine, hiding 
the cut off wall is not.",Positive,1

monthly/weekly"". And a big trouble: Used it for 3 month. Had troubles with 
signing up at start and gave up - I used it without account just on one 
phone. About a week ago received strange email about password from support 
(they have my email but didn't sign me in?). Looked strange, frankly 
speaking, so I ignored the email and decided to try to register one more 
time. I used option ""sign up with facebook"", was glad to see title ""without 
data loss"" and when i finally registered... all my habits and data 
disappeared from interface. Sent email to support with screens and

3337,"I paid for premium some time ago. Just got a new phone and installed the app, and was unpleasantly surprised to find that my email address ""was not found in our database"". This apparently means that all my synced data, habits, and history are completely gone. I created a new profile with the same email address, but the app still does not appear to be syncing at all. I'll continue to use the app for now, as I still like it best out of all habit trackers, but be warned there is NO backup/sync support here.",Positive,1

3348,Decent app for habit tracking. Unsubscribing from their premium membership is a headache.,Negative,0
3349,"Nice app... But need to fix some bugs.. First app crashes when I click on ""Go premium"". Also even if I am connected to wifi some big image is not loading on home screen. Wondering what's that image...",Positive,1
3350,It is great for keeping track of my habits but I never get any reminders. I've checked my phone and all the permissions are there but still no reminders. I just get a tiny message that tells me the app is running but disappears without doing anything. I'll persevere a bit longer but if it doesn't remind me there isn't much point as I will forget to do things.,Positive,1
3351,Too costly for premium,Negative,0
3352,In theory it helps track habits but after 30 or 40 days the reminders stop appearing randomly then just disappear completely. Rest of the app works well. Perhaps its my device but be aware.,Positive,1
3353,Not used,Negative,0
3354,Super easy to use. Less friction. I like how users can discuss progress with each other. It's very helpful.,Positive,1

3357,Its okay. Premium version is more useful,Positive,1
3358,It is a good app I've been using it for quite some time and I think I m progressing and this really is helping me. Just a bit dissapointed bcs it doesn't have a full progress tracker as a graph and I wish they will install this feature nearby in the future hopefully.,Positive,1
3359,It's about what I'd expect from a habit tracker. I chose this over another one for the motivational quotes. Only they just just up as the error picture icon without the actual picture. if I can't get the picture can I at least get alternative text for the picture that has the quote? Moto z2 force,Negative,0
3360,I wish there are better graphs to see the dips and raises in my performance. The current one is way too compressed and looks just like a straight line inspite of the dips,Positive,1
3361,The app is great now some bugs are fixed. Notification/reminders still don't work for me. $6.99/month seems steep to record more than 5 habits.,Positive,1
3362,Good,Positive,1
3363,I think I like it but not fully sure yet. Was getting daily notifications then they stopped and I forgot all about some habits. Will restart again.,Positive,1
3364,The app design could be better,Positive,1
3365,Great app . could you guys add a option like task archive because there are some habits like typing practice i want to follow and don't want to delete the data Give a option to hide the habit without losing data,Positive,1
3366,I was unable to create checklists in the way I want. I'm better off using Microsoft Excel,Positive,1
3367,Nice one but it's expensive,Positive,1
3368,Why is it called Habit Bull upon installation and it also has a different app icon? Misleading...,Negative,0
3369,Good app but it doesn't have riminder as it says.,Positive,1

3388,This deserves 5 stars. But I am not able to see discussions since the last one week.,Negative,0
3389,Probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous.,Positive,1
3390,I really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track. Simple but effective. I used the free version for almost 2 years. At the end of the first year it reset and I lost all of my history. So before the end of the second year I bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again. I contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all. I still recommend it for tracking your habits but don't expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it,Positive,1
3391,Really enjoying this app but wish I could track more than 5 habits!!,Positive,1
3392,Too invasive and complicated.,Negative,0
3393,Nice app,Positive,1
3394,It delivers what it promises,Positive,1
3395,"It's a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits. I had been gifted premium early on, but I've found that the features have disappeared and I'm only seeing the base version. I like it enough that I want to buy it, but I worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews. I've also found a bug: when I have a goal set to 3x a week as ""success,"" the app doesn't recognize when I've had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section, whereas it's at 80% in the ""percent success"" section and many weeks of meeting my goal.",Positive,1
3396,It's good app But it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit,Positive,1
3397,Odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally,Negative,0

3400,pretty good app,Positive,1
3401,This app is good but I can't access 5 habit because I need premium to access it 🙅🤷,Positive,1
3402,Does exactly one thing - tracks habits - but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras (or ads). Clean interface. Sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work. No way to transfer data.,Positive,1
3403,I liked how I could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps (I had to input myself) and my notifications would only go off if I opened the app myself. Kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications...,Positive,1
3404,The sync feature doesn't work.,Negative,0
3405,Limited functionality but reliable.,Negative,0
3406,Went for the premium subscription without a doubt. Definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly. Edit: Everything's good but after changing phones I've suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesn't work.,Positive,1
3407,The app is great. I wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things. For me the notifications don't work unles I open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed.. other then that easy app to use and navigate.,Positive,1
3408,Don't get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times!,Positive,1
3409,Pretty average app,Positive,1
3410,The Reminder option is not working....I have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but Unfortunately....The basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work....kindly help by resolving this issue... Color code Options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit,Positive,1
3411,A great way to track goals but quite limited in functionaliry and the Google fit integration doesn't work.,Positive,1
3412,Could do with a reward or goal feature when habit followed.,Positive,1
3413,It's an okay app but I have found better ones such as I am sober. This needs to be paid for to be useful.,Positive,1
3414,The app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that I have logged in ☹️,Positive,1
3415,The free app is too limited. Other than that it's a good one!,Positive,1

3417,Synching between my Chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app. The color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive.,Negative,0
3418,App is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot don't opens the app. Evertime i need to log out and again log in it. Plz solve my issue,Positive,1
3419,I really like this application. Very well done!  My reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security. No option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information.  PLEASE ADD SECURITY!,Positive,1
3420,Good app but faulty notifications. The notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if I open the app. By that point it's too late. I need the reminders to work to be effective. I purchased the full version.,Positive,1
3421,It's ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages don't change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker. The App's look doesn't come exciting to look at as well.,Positive,1
3422,I paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation. They fix that problem.,Positive,1
3423,shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly. otherwise all around good app.,Positive,1
3424,😀,Negative,0
3425,good,Positive,1
3426,it’s a great app and works great. helps me keep track of whether or not I took pills or did excercises or not. However it lacks the feature of ”multiple times a day” So if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day. this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once. Does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature?,Positive,1
3427,I bought the paid verison. It does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers. But habits aren't as simple as it is... we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time. If I want to develop a habit of waking up by 7.. it shouldn't be a yes or no question... I should be able to enter the time track it over the month.,Positive,1
3428,I really like the app. Maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more,Positive,1
3429,Good,Positive,1
3430,Good app but only counts by day. 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well.,Positive,1

3436,Ok app,Positive,1
3437,"Great for progress. Their motivation quotes stopped working. Plus it doesn't remember which habit you were last viewing... so a pain in the ass ""weekly"" intrusive display. I specifically looked for this app. Because it's simple and easy on the eyes.",Positive,1

3444,Would love to see a yearly review .. Other than that awesome app,Positive,1
3445,Nice app. I wish there was an option to move a goal though. For example I want to workout 3 days a week. This app has you choose 3 set days. I don't necessarily know my schedule and would like to move around a goal. Otherwise I dig.,Positive,1
3446,Great,Positive,1
3447,Easy to use.,Positive,1
3448,Have used this app for almost two years. I loved the minimalistic features despite all other confusing apps out there. It would be great if worked on making it an aesthetic user interface .,Positive,1
3449,I really like the app. However few weeks ago I've changed my Phone for new one - Samsung Galaxy A51 and now I've problems with a widget.

3469,App is nice but somehow i m not able to delete the habbit which i recently added by mistake .pls guide,Positive,1
3470,"Efficient after set-up. Makes tracking easy. Would like to be able to set incriments on each individual category. Not a plus or minus ""1"" only",Positive,1
3471,Very good!! Could use some more flare. :),Positive,1
3472,Update on 8/13/20 fixed the reminder notifications. Thank you!,Positive,1
3473,It is a great app. Maybe it could have a more attractive interface.,Positive,1

3479,Very nice app......,Positive,1
3480,A very simple habit tracker. Easy to use.,Positive,1
3481,Useful,Positive,1
3482,So far so good! It does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after I've exited the app though... bit of a weird bug.,Positive,1
3483,Motivational and funny remiders really help in pushing to do the task,Positive,1
3484,Good,Positive,1

3487,Nice app. the icon got problem.,Negative,0
3488,Nice,Positive,1
3489,An improvement would be to see running total on all habits page. Quite expensive for what it does,Positive,1
3490,Good,Positive,1
3491,Good app,Positive,1
3492,good app...but they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits,Positive,1
3493,Its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict.,Positive,1
3494,Very useful and encourages motivation,Positive,1
3495,Notification features should be free.,Positive,1
3496,Good,Positive,1
3497,Very conveniant and useful. The reminder function is also really nice to stay on top of activities.,Positive,1
3498,Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!,Positive,1
3499,loving it so far! keeps me motivated :),Positive,1
3500,Good as motivation to track and tick off daily goals.,Positive,1
3501,Good app. No lags. Does what it says. I'm happy.,Positive,1
3502,Happy to see my progress. It's a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which I paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life.,Positive,1
3503,I'm a big kid. I'd love it if the circles you tap to colour in were star shaped.,Positive,1
3504,It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.,Positive,1
3505,If wish the images of quotes would have the previous option too,Positive,1
3506,I like the app but dont like the big list of discussions about guys not trying to masterbate at the bottom.,Positive,1
3507,It helps me to change my habbit,Positive,1
3508,Simple but effective.,Positive,1
3509,Wish it had a little more options but still great and easy app,Positive,1
3510,This has been a great app to build habits. I would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time. You can get more but theres a pay wall,Positive,1
3511,"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful.",Positive,1
3512,Great tool,Positive,1
3513,Very good quality app for habits,Positive,1
3514,Simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals,Positive,1
3515,Very Helpful app for us to quit/join any kind of habit With the help of this app i have now completed my 60 days of no smoking challenge Thankyou habit bull,Positive,1
3516,Already helped a lot. Wish it had more colors.,Positive,1
3517,Good habit tracking app!,Positive,1
3518,"Tracks many tasks in great detail (statistics available on averages and streaks, etc). It has progressive tasks, so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily (like drinking water) and come up with more info than ""pass/fail"". My only qualm is the color. The display is very busy and colorful. I would also like a quicker interface for ""progressive"" tasks.",Positive,1
3519,Why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same,Positive,1
3520,Great app,Positive,1
3521,"Wonderful app! I'm just wondering if I overlooked something, because if, for instance, I set a habit to ""every 3 days"" but end up doing it every 2 days instead, the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail? Which seems very strange to me, since I actually did better than needed!",Positive,1
3522,This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.,Positive,1
3523,It's a little too early to tell. So far pretty good.,Positive,1
3524,Really remarkable app.,Positive,1

3535,Loved it. Motivates me to keep me on track with my set targets.,Positive,1
3536,Ok,Positive,1
3537,I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,Positive,1
3538,Bug has been fixed! Now i can use it with all my devices!,Negative,0
3539,Great tool!,Positive,1

3556,It is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not,Positive,1

3567,it works well for me,Positive,1
3568,It would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbit..try not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app . Well built interface with motivational images loved it❤,Positive,1
3569,Its useful,Positive,1

3734,It takes forever to download,Negative,0
3735,I haven't even opened this app and it's already drained 30 percent of my battery! Wow. Waste of time and space.,Negative,0
3736,$50 for a simple app? No thanks.,Positive,1
3737,This is a really dumb app.,Negative,0
3738,This app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it. Very intrusive.,Negative,0
3739,Is quite expensive,Negative,0
3740,Tested on 4 Android versions and devices: 1• Reminders only work with screen on & app in foreground (app doesn't stay in memory!) 2• Can't rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom. 3• Every notification 'Perform' button click= annoying popup to confirm AGAIN- can't be disabled!! 4• Needs option for notification X minutes AFTER task start/end (Users need notification to inform what to start PLUS notification option to confirm it's done (at the task end time.)) Subscibe when fixed!,Positive,1
3741,"This app will create a ""Review my tasks"" reminder when you launch it for the first time and by default will set the reminder to ""5 hours before"". This can mean it will wake you up in the middle of the night with this reminder playing a loud notification sound. It ignores the Do not disturb mode of the phone. It fails to show any visual notification so you will not know why your phone is making sounds in the middle of the night.",Negative,0
3742,Too complicated UI design. I just need a mindless tracker,Negative,0
3743,"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!",Positive,1
3744,I just cannot be notified. Please. Fix it. So I could give 5 stars.,Negative,0
3745,Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.,Positive,1
3746,Too much ads appeared out of no where.,Negative,0
3747,Key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of $6.50 per month with the best deal. Simply shameless.,Positive,1
3748,The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.,Positive,1
3749,"Notifications don't work. It's a shame, because I wanted to buy a subscription. [EDIT] Okay, I already know what's going on. The operating system of my smartphone is MIUI. This app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off. At the same time, in the application settings I have the option: ""No restrictions - battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity."" Other applications similar to this one (ToDo, habits) work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving.",Negative,0
3750,The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.,Positive,1
3751,Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet,Negative,0
3752,It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.,Positive,1
3753,Подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения.,Negative,0
3754,I'm sure the dev is well intended. Just no for me. UX is terrible.,Positive,1
3755,"DON'T download. After installation my calendar was FULL of commercials! ""You won an iPhone"" events with alarms.",Negative,0
3756,Tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re-open. Can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription,Negative,0
3757,"read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription, they said all ""major"" features are available for free. No, no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty ""major"" in my book",Positive,1
3758,The pop up adverts are so loud ... Terible !,Negative,0
3759,Decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to-do list is completely unacceptable. Take no for an answer.,Negative,0
3760,very bad experience,Negative,0

3765,Buggy! Won't let me edit rewards. No.,Positive,1
3766,"Auto-fail only works if you go to each task? That's not auto fail. Makes no 
sense. Might as well go back to Life RPG. that feature was the only reason 
I even tried this. Subscription model ridiculous. Why would I pay a MONTHLY 
fee for some icons? They are helpful icons & necessary mostly, but that's 
just ridiculously expensive for some icons. A one time fee is reasonable. 
Even if it was like $5. I wanted to like this app, but this got in the way.",Negative,0
3767,My entire plan was suddenly removed,Negative,0
3768,This is worst task game in my life,Negative,0
3769,Somehow bought it's own subscription? Then I had trouble cancelling. Was enjoying til it stole my money. I never saw any payment authorization window.,Negative,0
3770,Uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature  ✔DONE,Negative,0
3771,One of the worst in the genre,Negative,0
3772,"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny.",Negative,0
3773,Way too complicated to use. This app could be so much simpler. The time I've wasted on it is time I could be doing tasks.,Negative,0
3774,It's not well organized. I couldn't organize my schedule nicely. I think it should be more simple and easy. Also reminder didn't work and i don't know why.,Positive,1
3775,auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.,Negative,0
3776,Very useful but completely loses it's value when you don't get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others. Other times you don't even get any I mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don't even get the reminder? Please fix this problem.,Positive,1
3777,Nice idea for an app but don't like the fact that you can't customize the hero to be a woman. Also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it. Edit - but there are no female icons.,Positive,1
3778,"So cool, but insanely expensive. Also, wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual. I have no reading comprehension issues, there is just no ""getting started"" section or similar. Then I saw the fees, $50?! WOW that is high! I hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps & am a big fan of supporting developers, but $50 is nuts. This isn't a service one subscribes to, ex. Spotify, and $50 is NUTS to purchase an app. Not trying to be mean & am fine paying but $50 is way high.",Positive,1

3782,"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!""",Positive,1
3783,I liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them.,Positive,1
3784,"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week",Positive,1
3785,It is complicated.,Negative,0
3786,Price is very high for Indian users. We don't get 1/10 of what a US citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don't make a sense.,Negative,0
3787,Is a pretty good app but it's got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things I've done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day?,Positive,1
3788,Quite good one but I prefer single purchase option. But seriously I like the statistics. Well I saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup.,Positive,1
3789,I'm not interested in subscriptions. One time fee would be fine by me.,Positive,1
3790,Kind of ha are to get the hang of. Maybe I'm just stupid! IDK!! But I never did figure it out...,Positive,1
3791,Convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking. Stats can't be reset. All the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled. It's also weird how 'done' can't be hidden.,Negative,0
3792,"doesn't do what I need it to do with setting recurring alarms, such as every 3 hours forever. it just says ""how many times"" do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly. Just daily, weekly, etc.",Negative,0
3793,"Repeats tick now...however I encountered another problem. There's no way to restore ""purchases"". Meaning if you subscribe and than reset/wipe the app or your phone, you can't use the subscription features anymore. And to get it back you have to completely resubscribe.",Negative,0
3794,The ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous. Charge a single flat rate.  If the style does change to flat rate/ad free I'll gladly change my review.,Positive,1

3800,"Almost perfect... I only wish it had more to do with the ""game"" aspect. It's basically a to-do list or planner. Sure, it gives you some ""gold"" and experience points based on your completed tasks, but they amount to nothing, as there is nothing to do with either once collected. No built-in items to purchase, no character creation or customisation... disappointing. That being said, the tasks are easy to create and customise. I feel more organised than usual. So, thanks, I guess.",Positive,1
3801,I tried to set task to only do wednesday and friday and it wouldent work so I uninstaled. Apart from that its a good app.,Positive,1
3802,Not for me. I was hoping for something with an alarm. Doesn't help if I don't get a reminder. Looks interesting though,Positive,1
3803,"This app is incredibly unintuitive. Attempting to create an event with specific start and end dates is overcomplicated. I still can't get the ""specific dates"" option to function properly in the calendar. The app freezes if you delete the preset characteristics. This should not have left beta with so many duplication errors. Please fix this. I regret paying for this app. Edit: Additionally, deleting an occurrence of a reoccurring task only ones previous entries in it's place.",Negative,0
3804,Działa ale zwykła aplikacja habits naprawdę wystarczy,Negative,0
3805,Application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing - Duplicate Task feature doesn't duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated Tasks. So you cannot create a Template Task which could be used to create other similar deep Task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures. This is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently. Without this i will be forced to look at less,Positive,1
3806,"This seems like a great app, but if you fall off the wagon or take a long vacation, with dozens of daily tasks, then there's no realistic way to recover, because you have to dismiss potentially thousands of pass/fails until you can get a list of just current and relevant tasks remaining for today. Multi-select helps, but still no good after a summer break, or older user with a 12 tasks triggering daily for a year = 4380 to dismiss by tapping each one. Could solve with a ""Select All"" feature.",Positive,1
3807,Guys I really love this app and feature am.bkt confused of putting repeated reminder as am use to it and I love that reminder alarm to make me awake all the time I miss something. I can't find that or else please help me guiding for that..and also upload more videos on YouTube for new users to understand as you guys have hardly any video,Positive,1
3808,I don't know how useful this will be yet. But I should point out that subscribing to your Instagram shouldn't be an infinitely repeatable task xD,Positive,1

3810,"The presentation is slick, highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to ""just do one more thing before bed time"". Liking it! It would have been an easy 5 star if not for the widgets. Unfortunately they do not continue the established level of customizability. Especially rescaling elements of the Ui of ""All Tasks"" to fit it into a smaller screen is missing. Further, there is a bug that ""All tasks are done"" after clicking away two tasks.

3814,Good,Positive,1
3815,Same review as rpg gamify,Negative,0
3816,Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,Positive,1
3817,"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",Positive,1
3818,"Was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day, everyday. Duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way, but it clutters up the task list (like 8 lines so I'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water) and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list, both within and outside of the main task. I thought the ""repeat every 1 day, 8 times"" custom setting might work, but it's a different function.",Positive,1
3819,I am in love with this app so far. I wish there was an iOS version available to connect with my friends though... I would recommend this to everyone otherwise! 3 stars for now due to limited availability.,Positive,1
3820,App itself is nice but needs a lot of polish. Right now it's kind of a bugfest.,Positive,1
3821,App crashing a lot. Do look into it and solve the problem asap.,Negative,0
3822,A very good but incomplete idea. There is no way to track time spent on certain habits. there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour... Besides the statistics are super limited and basic.,Positive,1
3823,The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily. Or maybe we can import (by purchasing) some set of quests. For me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered. would be use it furthere more if not too complicated,Positive,1
3824,It would be great if the notifications actually works!! I don't get notified by any task I put in at all,Positive,1
3825,Ok but doesn't feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall,Positive,1
3826,"Setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it's good. The notifications aren't working on my phone, and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day, I'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird ""give me a notification 12 hours before"" The whole point of me getting a to-do list app was to have not only a list, but reminders, so until the notifications work I'll have to resort to a different app.",Positive,1
3827,Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.,Negative,0

3829,"There could be any difference between gold that we earn. If my rewards are ""cheat meal"" and ""netflix episode"" and tasks are ""run 10 km"" and ""read a book"", it shouldn't be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book...",Positive,1
3830,It crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment. Why not just make it $5 lifetime? Seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar.,Positive,1
3831,Everything requires you to pay money might as well make it a paid game instead of deceiving people for a free app,Positive,1
3832,i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested 'to dos' cuz i can never think of things to do,Positive,1
3833,The app is great but after using awhile it start to lag.,Positive,1
3834,Too much paid only,Negative,0
3835,This app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity,Positive,1
3836,Needs fixes... Like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit... Looks like the developers don't use it themselves.,Positive,1
3837,Suggestion: Can tasks take things from the inventory? Maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task.,Negative,0
3838,"Don't like it very much, but I think it's just not for me. It's very complex and deep with tasks and such (I could even set the percentage of fear for a task... What??) so I didn't get very far before I just said ""forget it"". My life is too busy for such complexity.",Negative,0

it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time.

3842,It is a good application. It is very useful. It is just okay.,Positive,1
3843,Great app. Needs  a few things like task fail without consequences option. Mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase. Not every one has everything connected to Internet all the time.,Positive,1
3844,It's such a spectacular idea but I had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day-to-day basis.,Negative,0
3845,This is ok!  But it required bunch of upgrade and some new features!  Will keep it! But wait till is it perfect!,Positive,1
3846,Good but not ok,Positive,1

3848,It's a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time...,Negative,0
3849,The concept is good. But why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though I have turned the notification on? This is very bad.,Negative,0
3850,But then it started locking up everytime I tried to load it.  ←ved it until then.,Negative,0
3851,"I can't be the only one multitasking. Therefore, I don't have time to figure out a basic program. I put in a picture and it was so tiny! I put in my tasks yet some are ""timeless"", some are daily, and there was powerlifting! I'm physically crippled!",Negative,0
3852,I need help from dev. One of my favorite apps of all time combines scheduling and rpg gaming in one not 5 stars because I bought premium but when I logged into my kindle premium status didnt show up neither did my other data from my phone please help devs!,Positive,1
3853,"Just staryed using it. There's a pretty massive learning curve, especially when it comes to the complete customization of your character, characteristics, skills and in general ""finding the flow"" that works for you but so far it's been really helpful and an enjoyable experience.",Positive,1
3854,Was really good but I think it'd be even better if it had a widget that could just take up a whole screen and mark complete on tasks from there,Positive,1
3855,Ivery good app.. I would recommend it,Positive,1
3856,I like alot about this app but really want to add one thing to make it round out my gamify experience. Skill tree. I would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills. Linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge. Some skills may need levels to unlock from other skills or need a basis in 2 skills to be usable. It really would make this app a huge step above any other gasification app.,Positive,1

3861,"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps",Negative,0

3867,I love this app. I only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts.,Positive,1
3868,"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.",Positive,1
3869,Strong fallout/ skyrim feel. But full buy price is 45$? Even those games' price are lower on sale. And I bought them on sale. Other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars. And the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background?? I don't sub apps I buy them.Sub is for something like Netflix and Spotify...,Positive,1

3872,Good.,Positive,1
3873,Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!,Positive,1
3874,Good app. Minus a star as you cant manually sort task lists with your finger and change their priority that way,Positive,1
3875,I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks,Positive,1
3876,It is a lot better than the other apps out. An 8 or 16bit UI makeover would be dope. The pixel look and feel. Always nostalgic,Positive,1
3877,"It's a great app and very useful, but I would like for it to add an options. ""Delete after completion."" This means it would repeat until you hit the check button.",Positive,1

3890,Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?,Positive,1
3891,Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.,Positive,1
3892,Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.,Positive,1
3893,Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though,Positive,1
3894,Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,Negative,0
3895,COMPLETE! A tip: The task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability,Positive,1

3902,Nice,Positive,1
3903,This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,Positive,1
3904,Jibj,Negative,0

3910,Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,Positive,1
3911,"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",Positive,1

3916,this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work!!! im ao happy you listen to your customers EDIT: now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold.,Positive,1

Pity they monetised it in every available orifice, fukugly full screen ads, in-app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription, all conspire to overshadow the app itself, as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its ""gaming"" USP.",Positive,1
3922,"A good app in general. I would love to be able to have ""loose"" tasks, for example: practice spanish twice a week. Which should be completed at least twice every week. Also, why not allow icons to be any emoji?",Positive,1
3923,So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!,Positive,1
3924,This would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem I didn't like. You can't choose PM or AM times and it's just a annoying and confusing.,Negative,0
3925,I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.,Positive,1
3926,I really like it. I wish the icon could be custom made. For example IF I could use my own png files as icons that would be cool. Especially for achievements.,Positive,1
3927,Why this app consumes so MUCH traffic in background? This month it hit the 500mb (!!!) in bg. Is this app free of malware elements?,Positive,1
3928,Fun way to track and reward yourself guilt-free. Lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice. My only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section.,Positive,1
3929,"Update: Thank you for the fix, also if possible, can you consider adding an 
icon (a way) for quickly go to subtasks? (It helps User Experience a lot 
because now, we need to click / hold 2 times for go to subtasks of a parent 
task, and it takes a lot of time for the tasks with many level. I already 
update the rating, please let me know your feedback for the above and when 
the new update is available, i will change it to 5 stars Regards, ----- 
Please fix the ""Add subtasks"" feature in Subtasks list of a parent task 
(When clicking on ""Edit"" icon, it show list of subtasks to select, and a 
""Add subtasks"" link, but click on it show nothing) -> It affects User 
Experience a lot because when we need to add subtasks, we need to ""back"" a 
lot to go to main task list -> then add normal task -> then go to parent 
task to mark it as subtask Thank you. It is urgent so please let me know 
your feedback then I will increase the rating",Positive,1
3930,"Reward section should be devided into multiple catagory like item, armor, 
food etc to avoid difficulty in selecting one we want to buy with gold.. or 
you could add the feature to add a tast to costomable group we can create..",Positive,1
3931,"I like this update.. however i still think this app could be better in UI.. 
in future, could you add the visual improvement like adding progress bar in 
each characteristics and skills so we can track our progress more fun.. 
also just suggestions you could add health and magic point like in real RPG 
game.. alot people would like that i guess..",Positive,1
3932,Excellent features but needs more exciting UI,Positive,1
3933,"I quite enjoyed this amazing little app for a week then I realized I can't 
view my past before like 6 days, if I could save it somewhere in graph form 
that would've been the 5th star.",Positive,1
3934,"It's a good app, but it would be better if more optiosns were added in the 
repeat section, like being able to choose the repeat to occur every 
second/third/etc day/week/etc",Positive,1
3935,So what is.the function of coins?,Negative,0
3936,First app to actually motivate me.   Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the achievements have no automatic templates and can't be set with conditions connected to the auto-fail function. That would be great for building habits.,Positive,1
3937,I love everything! I just want the XP bar to have a cool animation of actually filling up in front of me!!! It's the only reasons I still use RPG life...I know it's petty...but animations are important for an app,Positive,1
3938,Like it so far! My only suggestion being a shop where you can buy icons or something. Gotta put use for the coins,Positive,1
3939,"Excellent for what it advertises. I wish for a way to spend the gold or use the exp. that way it would provide incentive to ""play"" more for those who wish to use this app as intended.",Positive,1
3940,This app so far has the cleanest ui of all the apps ive tried of this genre. The task set up is so quick to use and the duplicate feature??? Fantastic for someone like me who has to set up working out tasks with similar outlines. The one thing I'd say is additional icons and maybe a few templates to help people get started other than the default. Otherwise keep up the good work!,Positive,1
3941,I really like the idea of this app. It's pretty easy to use and understand and if you liked D&D growing up it'll remind you of the character building/levelling processes (which is great). If I could make one suggestion; add a falconry guy to the avatars. 😉,Positive,1
3942,Achievements should have reward options such as exp/gold.   Otherwise it is a neat app.,Positive,1
3943,A bit of headache in beginning.. but awesome!,Positive,1
3944,Great app. An alarm would be great with new or better icons in context with the app,Positive,1
3945,I really like the idea and would of easily voted 5 on it but it has no alerts or alarms on mine to remind me to do the set task. Doesn't even send me a notification.,Positive,1
3946,This is a good app for motivation,Positive,1
3947,"I believe it's awesome. But for the next update can you please use "" : "" instead of "" - "" in front of numbers? It looks like a minus symbol!",Positive,1
3948,It was fantastic until it started freezing every time I went to tasks. Is there a way to fix this?,Positive,1
3949,Love the app! I wish there were more features such as adding icons to tasks or adding a quest map.,Positive,1
3950,Widget finished task should be gone. It bother me that it's still with my task at hand.,Positive,1
3951,Nice app best of the ones ive tried. But really think about adding some graphics and a much less boring UI (look at SuperBetter for instance) also a 'multiplayer' aspect is a glaring omission that almost all your competitors have..  Try to have stats actually have some meaning or  a way for us to give them meaning.,Positive,1
3952,"Edit: For some reason, the timezone of the app is not the same as my actual timezone. Tasks are ""overdue"" even though the day is not over for me... However, it's still a great app with lots of potential! I like the slick interface and the whole concept. Once you can differentiate the characteristics from the skills, the fun begins. Keep improving this app, it's definitely my favorite RPG lifestyle app.",Positive,1
3953,Could we customize notification sound for successful tasks? I want to add final fantasy victory theme but still don't know how to... Besides that i really like this apps..,Positive,1
3954,By far the most in-depth app of this style. Tried Habitica and others and they were so underdeveloped in comparison in my opinion.,Negative,0
3955,Great software for those who want to succeed I have been using this software for a year and I am completely satisfied with it Install it right now,Positive,1

3960,Love the app and the fact the devs listen and add new updates all the time,Positive,1
3961,I just started the app a few days ago and I really like it. I told my kids it would have been nice to have this when they were young. The fight for chores might have been a little less of a struggle.,Positive,1
3962,Great so far,Positive,1
3963,Great app! It helped me get my life together.,Positive,1

3967,I really like this app. I appreciate how much thought has been put into it but it is complicated app. I wish there was a video to understand all features even though the help document is quite thorough.,Positive,1
3968,Good,Positive,1
3969,挺好用的，挺好玩的，而且还可以同步。,Negative,0
3970,Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at! My only feedback is that I wish the color of the widget changed to match the chosen in-app theme because the yellow list kinda sticks out from my background. Other than that the app is perfect! Thank a lot Levor!!,Positive,1
3971,Very useful,Positive,1
3972,It's great for planning out goals of any time frame whether it be short or long term. It's also extremely customizable which I adore a lot.,Positive,1
3973,Great app. I would love to buy it for lifetime but the price is too steep for a student in india. Hopefully like Netflix and Spotify etc have done with their prices for india. You can give us some price which will be affordable in our country.,Positive,1
3974,Fun way to manage tasks and improve yourself.,Positive,1

3981,"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you Edit: Gonna subscribe soon! Can you add sounds when consuming items, please? Thanks!",Positive,1
3982,I have only had it for a few days and don't fully understand every feature.. but it is the only to do list app that has so far worked for me. Probably because of it being based on a reward system even if the rewards are only virtual.,Positive,1
3983,Great app for goal setting & tracking in a gamified way.,Positive,1
3984,I love it! Incredibly customizable. Keeps me on track to do the things I want to do!,Positive,1
3985,Very Active App,Positive,1
3986,I think it's a pretty straightforward app. It definitely helps when you need to place certain tasks throughout your week as a reminder.,Positive,1
3987,Amazing! This app has had a really large positive impact on my life (in just a few short months). Would definitely reccommend ^-^,Positive,1
3988,It's the best task gamification app I have ever seen Even if you don't need the gamification it's still better than most other to do apps in task organization Edit : if you are capable please add the option of adding files to tasks like some other to do apps,Positive,1
3989,Love the app but i have a question. I have a morning routine set up with subtasks. Is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab? Also i would love it if i could order my tasks customly without having to assign a time to them. This is by far the best app i have found for setting to do's for yourself. As an adult with adhd I love the fun childish functionality without it looking like a childs game on my phone.,Positive,1
3990,Encourages me to complete task,Positive,1
3991,The developer is pure genius. Well execution on customizable gamification app execution. I have bought a subscription as soon as using it for 10 minutes. I would like to make a business inquiry. Is the contact information listed here updated? Do you check your e-mails often? I am looking for a firm communication channel with the developer.,Positive,1
3992,This is a great app. I recommend a search bar though for both skills and characteristics,Positive,1
3993,RPG bolado,Negative,0
3994,This app is just what I needed to make progress on my goals. Contains a whole bunch of features and customisability. It is also easy to use. I only have an Issue with the Task List Widget not updating properly after completing a task.,Positive,1
3995,I've been doing this for several days and it's been working wonders,Negative,0
3996,Probably the best task managing app out there.,Positive,1
3997,Awesome app overall. It would be great to see some kind of progress functionality inside tasks. For example counter 0-10(or any other number you input) for push-ups / book pages / words learned etc.,Positive,1

4003,Great App. Changing my Life,Positive,1
4004,Really cute but I'm more into minimalist designs. It works really well tho if the interface seems like ur thing. I like that they have a reward system. I might just get it back just for that bc no other app that I've seen has that.,Positive,1

4014,Perfect!!!,Positive,1
4015,Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.,Positive,1
4016,Beautiful and detailed app! There are two features that would make it more useful: 1) a counter to keep track of quantity (example: alcohol drinks); 2) a limit which causes a fail if you go over (example: limit 14 drinks in a week or 2 per day),Positive,1
4017,awesome,Positive,1

4023,Nice app very use full,Positive,1
4024,Amazing.,Positive,1
4025,It's a really great app I love most that it reminds you about your tasks since I tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants it's easy and fun to use especially with the reward system I think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly I love the app it's perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need,Positive,1
4026,It really really good.,Positive,1
4027,Seems to be useful so far.,Positive,1
4028,"Awesome app to gamify tasks. I've been using it for 3 months and I love many things about it. I won't write them because I can only type 500 characters. BUT I wish it could include ""time tracking"", like the one from Toggl. Also I strongly wish it could have a desktop version (and IOS). Another thing would be to sincronize with a google calendar, not only the one inside the app (I also think the calendar needs accuracy). Lastly being able to interact with other users and a ranking would be great.",Positive,1
4029,The idea is just wow. Well executed.,Positive,1
4030,Great work mates!,Positive,1
4031,Great productivity app to stay organized,Positive,1
4032,I really love this app It's fantastic in many ways. I wish I could adjust the overdue settings as tasks are set as overdue too quickly for me :),Positive,1
4033,Amazing,Positive,1
4034,Does everything I want it to do and more!,Positive,1
4035,Amazing app!! You can literally modify EVERYTHING into the way you prefer! It's a little complex but with only minutes you can understand it's interface and fall in love with it. I love it even more because you can go up levels and it makes really more fun doing your tasks! No ads and almost everything for free. Pretty amazing!,Positive,1
4036,Hmm... I like it,Positive,1

4038,Gufy,Negative,0
4039,This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time),Positive,1
4040,So far loving this app,Positive,1
4041,I enjoy this app because I am a task oriented person and I can see how much I have completed and the XP gaming quality to it makes me feel like I m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work,Positive,1

4055,Great app,Positive,1
4056,It's a really great app. Although it would be better if you could use costom icons for tasks and rewards and it would be better if the app didn't blur low quality pictures (as I like to use pixelated pictures). I also love the fact that this app works offline. Thank you for the great work 👍,Positive,1
4057,Estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse.,Negative,0
4058,Very neat,Positive,1
4059,"First of all it's an excellent app. I like the fact that it is highly customizable. However, I'd like to make a suggestion. Your app lacks the ""emotional"" aspect a bit. I suggest to add support of small custom avatar-like images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons. This way a task will associate with something positive/inspirational. Pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen. Do not understimate the power of visual associations.",Positive,1

4115,Limited habit data,Negative,0
4116,Great so far. I only wish I could set up one task for more than 1 day. It's kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily. If I could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing. Also making it so I can choose a time range would also be really helpful. Some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now I can only choose a time for a reminder. It'll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these. Thanks!,Positive,1

4132,You can have just 5 habits for free. We should have more,Positive,1
4133,"I like this app and I bought Premium, even it was a little expensive (5,49 Euro). What I don't like is: Habits ""with a numeric value"" don't allow ""at least 0 times a day"". If you want to do something 6 times a week, with the possibility to do it twice on one day, it will stay undone the other days (-1 *). Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits! After a removal of any named defect I will change my rating.",Positive,1
4134,I like this app. It's simple and gets the job done. Only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version.,Positive,1
4135,"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome.",Positive,1
4136,I can't arrange my habits in the order I want. I have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical.,Positive,1

4138,It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row. Switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything. You have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like.,Positive,1
4139,I have enough credit but I can't purchase for premium,Positive,1
4140,I don't get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so I am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app,Positive,1
4141,Unfortunately the free version does not provide enough functionality for me. I am trying to track habits but it stopped me at 7.,Negative,0
4142,"Two requests please: 1) Allow the user to set what time the day/recurrent tasks reset. Not everyone's ""day"" ends at midnight! 2) Propagate the theme selected to the widget. If I have selected a dark blue theme, my widget should have the same dark blue icon(s), not a bright red HabitNow one. Good so far, more customization would make it great...thanks!",Positive,1
4143,Can't set times for when tasks need to be completed. Can't tick off tasks for the next day,Negative,0
4144,Dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app. Otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive.,Positive,1
4145,I would give 5 stars if it had the feature to rearrange the items with your specific order instead or being predetermined,Negative,0
4146,Its a good app but i think thers some glitch i cant have more than 6 tasks when i create one it just dosen't show.,Positive,1
4147,lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order. habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them. if you do fix it i will purchase this app,Negative,0
4148,"For $4.99 to $9.99, I'd like more widgets and customization. As it stands, the main widget, ""List"", is block white.",Negative,0
4149,Please give Google login option. So I can backup my data easily.,Positive,1
4150,This app is really nice and makes me to build good habits but only thing is annoying in this app is you can't import more than 7 habits until you get premium.,Positive,1
4151,I like it for now but even after buying the premium version there are a limited number of categories. I have 3 businesses & thus the single briefcase icon doesn't work for me. I would like to be able have a different category icon for each of my various tasks & a larger range of icon options of categories available. There isn't even an icon for pets ! That is super important !,Positive,1
4152,Best hai ji,Positive,1
4153,It's pretty good! User friendly app. Developer gotta work or widget improvements though. Other that than It gets the job done.,Positive,1
4154,Very nice app! How likely is is that you will implement achievements e.g. for streaks?,Positive,1
4155,Nice app,Positive,1
4156,Good App! ❗BUT❗ Need more features for premium users 4 sure.,Positive,1
4157,Very helpfull i use it often to track my studies and to make sure i take out and put in my retainer. When i start getting a paycheck i plan on buying the full version.,Positive,1
4158,Those having trouble after closing app n not geting reminders and alarms the ans is go to ur mob settings and add Habit now app to wont's sleep,Negative,0
4159,"Its an amazing app. Can recurring habits have something like ""every 2nd monday of the month""? Also, how can I finish a habit 2x in the same day?",Positive,1
4160,Its very helpful,Positive,1
4161,"It's pretty good but for me it's missing one feature. Most of my habits are to be done a certain number of times per week so it would be great to have a week view where you can see the ticks and crosses for each habit so far that week, for all habits at the same time (I know you can see them one at a time by clicking ""last 7 days"" but clicking on this for one habit closes this view for another). Then you can get a good overview of how much you have left to do that week.",Positive,1
4162,Wow bt one thing make me pain . That is money,Positive,1
4163,It's awesome,Positive,1
4164,Great app. Very stable so far.,Positive,1
4165,Good so far,Positive,1
4166,Nice app!,Positive,1
4167,So far so good.,Positive,1
4168,I wish if I can mentor my progress in habits by points not only by days,Positive,1
4169,Thank you,Positive,1
4170,Nice app,Positive,1
4171,Nice,Positive,1
4172,Love to use,Positive,1
4173,Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed. Was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to HabitNow ❣️ Some other useful features: - Add a length to a task or habit - Be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day,Positive,1
4174,Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!,Positive,1
4175,Easy to use,Positive,1
4176,Ufff me ayuda demasiado xq soy de las personas q se olvidan las cosas y esta app es la unica q encontre q tenia alarma,Negative,0
4177,Its good i wish i had different lists and could personalize the sound my alarms made each tine they went off,Positive,1
4178,Dashboard/ charts better be inclusive all habits. Not just per one habit. Also download to excel would be nice,Positive,1
4179,Does exactly what it says. Would be 5 stars if the Categories could be customised.,Negative,0
4180,Wish I could add more habits,Positive,1
4181,Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.,Positive,1
4182,"Hi, I would've given this app 5/5 if I hadn't already spent so much time exploring it. It's so cumbersome as it is to check what I have scheduled for a day in the future. I have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a ""month-view- interface. Please make it more intuitive, let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the past/future. Let me also edit tasks/habits from a day in the future.",Positive,1
4183,I wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit I want in any order I want. It lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way I need it. Also wish the conpleted habit or task would disaapear after I complete each day. It either stays where it is or goes to bottom. Other than these I like it.,Positive,1
4184,Great app with an ugly widget. If the widget was cleaner I'd give 5 stars.,Positive,1
4185,Not bad if you want to install,Negative,0
4186,Love this,Positive,1
4187,Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle,Positive,1
4188,Easy to use and the alarm works great,Positive,1
4189,Addition of day counter for negative habits will be great. Also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful. And widget isn't working.,Positive,1
4190,I love it! Only problem I found is that you can't edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance.,Positive,1
4191,Good,Positive,1
4192,"Everything is good, I bought the premium after 5 minutes used! But one question, why we can't create a task with a date which is the day before??? (eg; Today is 11 May. I can't create a task on date 10 May. Sometimes we might be overlooked or too busy to add task, but we need to have a record of what we had done on the day, it can make us feel so ""completed"")",Positive,1
4193,Please create desktop app,Positive,1
4194,Good,Positive,1
4195,I really love the setup of this app. I wish it had the ability to see weekly progress in a bullet journal style. That would make it perfect for me.,Positive,1
4196,Easy and practical !,Positive,1
4197,Easy to use. Great for creating new routines and habits,Positive,1
4198,Like the app. Either I haven't found it or they don't have it in the free app but I would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day. Would be fun to see at the end of the month all that I did on one calendar.,Positive,1
4199,Nice app. Quick question can I add new categories when adding my habits? I'm not see an option. Only the options that came with the app is available. Is it that everything else must go under other? Please advise,Positive,1
4200,The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for,Positive,1
4201,This is a very good app... just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice.,Positive,1
4202,Why there's no option to change schedule?,Negative,0
4203,Preaty nice but they could improuve the UI it took me some time to figure it out. And I know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app,Positive,1
4204,Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.,Positive,1
4205,Works Great,Positive,1
4206,"Funciona bien, pero si le hacen falta cosas, tengo la versión premium, resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías (donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría) por ejemplo: como sabemos, existe categoría denominada ""study"" pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí. Sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se HACE.",Negative,0
4207,I like using the app and my weekly progress. I would like to see a total of how many things I did each day and maybe a graph? I like positive reinforcement.,Positive,1
4208,Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.,Positive,1
4209,Great at 1st,Positive,1
4210,Alarm not working at all. I have checked all settings in my phone they all are on. Could you please assist me on same.,Negative,0
4211,"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.",Positive,1
4212,Great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it. Have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency.,Positive,1
4213,não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa,Negative,0
4214,I haven't started using it officially but I'm giving a 4 star because the User Interface is on point... I'm starting my habits on monday... Hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the UI. Thank you,Positive,1
4215,"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.",Positive,1
4216,Great app! How can I change the alarm sound,Positive,1
4217,awesome app .. i like the daily work and habit tracking .. thanks guys,Positive,1
4218,Helped me a lot,Negative,0
4219,I liked it I just have to many things I want to put in it and I can't afford to pay for premium.,Positive,1
4220,I like it. It's quite easy to use. Would it be possible to sync data between devices? That would be a lovely plus!,Positive,1
4221,I liked it but once I got it I saw a had no need for it and I felt like I don't need it as much as others.,Positive,1
4222,Simple and practical,Negative,0
4223,Easy to add habits and tasks; you see everything for that dat,Positive,1
4224,it s great,Positive,1
4225,Set a color which depends on percentage for goals.,Negative,0
4226,good enough👍👍👍,Positive,1
4227,"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am.""",Positive,1
4228,Good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress,Positive,1
4229,Good,Positive,1
4230,Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!,Positive,1
4231,Please add an option to update habit/task status from the notification bar when I receive notification on the set time. Overall good app.,Positive,1
4232,It is a good for organising daily task n making habit,Positive,1
4233,"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect.",Positive,1
4234,Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,Positive,1
4235,Handy habit helper,Positive,1
4236,Good app. Wish there were more customization,Positive,1
4237,I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.,Positive,1
4238,great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks,Positive,1
4239,Very useful! Reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done. Would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version Thank you!,Positive,1
4240,This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.,Positive,1
4241,this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,Positive,1
4242,So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),Positive,1
4243,quite a good app for me,Positive,1
4244,I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,Positive,1
4245,this helped to fix my life,Negative,0
4246,It's good.when I install it.I have many plans every day. Thanks for your program.🌹🌹🌹,Positive,1

4251,I love this app so much. 5 starts definitely. I just got the app and I love it. But there is only one thing I really want a different background on the app. But for that I need premium I don't think that's fare. But 5 stars love it!,Positive,1

4260,"This is the app that i kept from numerous time management apps. All are full of features but not practical. This app serves me clear cut. Habit & Task, simple and most practical 😍 But I can't set the ""ending"" reminder alarms for a habit, i can only start but we need a alarm that tell us to stop 😒",Negative,0

4274,Great app! Instantly bought premium! Would it be possible to scale the widget (or make a new one) that's fits a small 1x1 size? I replaced my previous habit tracker with this app and I really miss that feature! I'm sure it will help others too! Keep up the good work!,Positive,1
4275,I struggle with starting any new habits. This was instrumental in even beginning a new habit. Super easy to set up. I get reminders. There's nightly accountability to check off the daily habits. I purchased the premium as I decided I wanted more than 7 new habits!,Positive,1
4276,Excellent... Lovely and really helpfull! Thanks!,Positive,1
4277,It is an amazing app and very easy to use it sends me notifications so I can keep my progress every single time I look at the app it motivates me to complete all tasks and habits Trust me you will love ticking those boxes after a task is done amazing satisfaction definitely would recommend,Positive,1

I would love to view just the tasks or just the habits in addition to current view. I just got this app & liked it so much that I bought it.

4322,"Great app. 5 stars for sure. What would make it even better from my POV: /- An option to set recurring tasks. e.g I want to pay my bills every month on the 1st, and I want to add a single recurring task. New Habit has the option ""How often do you want to do it"", but New Task does not. /- An ""are you sure"" question before deleting or undo option after. /- The option to filter the list of tasks by category. Especially if you also use it for work tasks, like I do",Positive,1
4323,Does exactly what it should do. Gives you zero BS. Helped me create purpose and structure during quarantine so that I don't go crazy.,Negative,0
4324,"I'm really enjoying this app, but I wish it had the following: more view, color, and size options, analytics on all habits done in the course of a week or month, and better widgets. The text is so small in the widget and the texts for the habits in the app doesn't stand out. Oh and setting rewards for completing habits would be really cool. A ""Rewards Earned"" section that you check off once you use the reward (like buy yourself an ice cream).",Positive,1

4366,I've never rated something on Google Play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something. This is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way. It allows you to view the progress you're making with habits.

4425,"The daily reminder for any task only works if the task is tapped ""completed"" either through notification (completed/snooze) or through App even if the task is actually not completed . If you swipe the notification without tapping on ""completed"", the daily reminder stops. This is funny. The ""daily reminder"" should continue daily whether the task for a particular day is completed or not completed.",Positive,1
4426,"I hate that ""Note"" symbol showing up on tasks even I didn't put any notes and that makes me go crazy because I have to open each and every task to see that I have put notes. It worked fine when I downloaded it. Please fix it. It really annoying.",Negative,0
4427,"Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an ""assigned to me"" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating.",Negative,0
4428,"All tasks now appear with a ""note"" icon, even if there is no note there. Completely unreliable with the reminders of repeated tasks: -Sometimes the ""remind me at"" goes blank for no apparent reason. -Check the task after midnight of its due date and you won't get reminded of this task the next day -The app either forgets ""remind me"" or ""repeat"" part after one cycle of task done).",Negative,0

4433,Terrible I'm sure I'm not the only one saying this but I'll add mine. It used to be a great app as wunderlist but is now terrible. I can only assume its intentional to force people elsewhere because there's some money to be made. An added recent quirk is it doubling any hylerlink in the notes whenever you close the keyboard ( a more insane quirk i couldn't dream up). Don't bother.,Negative,0
4434,Update made it so that every entry has a note attached and doesn't have the ability to actually edit the note on android. Doesn't happen on the PC version of the app.,Positive,1

4441,Anybody who selected 5 starts CLEARLY did not EVER use Wunderlist. But it is IMPOSSIBLE not to make the comparison consideration for a review. This company plays foul. You buy out an excellent competitor for this app you are pushing and then rather than improve on it you produce something unquestionably inferior. Dastardly deed and regardless of your improvements there are others out there I'll choose. You won't get my support full stop. 1. I can't add a task and have it emailed to the team member. They have to keep checking ToDo all during the day wasting time. 2. We lost the crucial COMMENTS section. This allowed a team member to provide a status update or send a query. This had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task. It allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback. Now we have to go to a different app like email or whatsapp to respond. 3. Can't sort the tasks according to TEAM MEMBER. So I gotta scroll and scroll to find all tasks I gotta talk to a team member about. There's more but out of words,Positive,1

Microsoft commented on my original review saying to contact customer service via email I did and they told me to look at one setting but my phone doesn't have that setting.

4531,Sadly Microsoft have a history of replacing perfectly efficient apps with less efficient ones. They have purchased and killed off the immensely popularWunderlist no doubt hoping they could transfer it's users to their vastly inferior product. I have just give it a third try out but Todo is still a 2nd rate'camel' of an implementation. I have been using remember the milk which is fairly excellent but will move to Aoya which may suit me better.,Positive,1
4532,Does job,Negative,0
4533,There's no option to export my task list if I want to migrate to another app. Or just dump my task data into a CSV. I'm out of todo to avoid getting locked in. Google is less evil that way. I can move out of its ecosystem any time I want and export all my data.,Negative,0

4544,"Migrated from Wunderlist because I had to and a feature I absolutely want and don't have is notifications of new tasks or completed tasks.

4545,"This app only notifies me of one reminder at a time, so if I don't clear the notification, it stops notifying me of other reminders. It also doesn't allow scheduling more than 1 reminder for a task on a given day. ""Repeat"" doesn't help. You can't duplicate a task to make a 2nd reminder either, I have to make another task and manually copy and paste the name, notes, and date.

4561,Nothing more than a simple to do list without any decent widgets. Nobody wants to open the app every time they want to create a new task or check something they already did,Positive,1

4570,Why this so doesn't remind me?,Negative,0
4571,This app has a great ui and ux but there's one thing that really makes it useless. I'd doesn't sync in the background so I add a tskl via desktop it'll probably not show on my phone unless i open the app on my phone. It makes the app risky if you need to count on your reminders. Another problem is the time suggestion when you create a task is always behind the keyboard and it's hard to use it like that/,Positive,1
4572,It mixes todays completed task by Tomorrow. Which is really bad experience and gives no happiness after completing a task. Todays completion must be removed and tomorrows list must be visible by tomorrow. Not today. Fix it.,Negative,0
4573,You'd thing MS can come up with something better. Very basic. You can't view tasks in your calendar. You can specify task start and end time. Recurring tasks sometimes don't respawn properly.,Positive,1
4574,Can't Sync I am unable to sync my phone account to PC account,Negative,0
4575,Doesn't respect silent mode.,Positive,1
4576,Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there,Negative,0
4577,MS has screwed up wunderlist the same as to skype.... So clunky and average poorly thought out; should have just changed wunderlists logo and colour scheme. The desktop version is slow (10s) to respond. You can be doing changes on the desktop and it get jammed up with app.,Negative,0
4578,App is great for the people who forget their tasks. I will be grateful if the company adds alarm reminders in this app.,Positive,1
4579,Not easy to use. And doesn't do a good job of keeping reminders,Positive,1
4580,I guess once you get the instructions you realize that a calendar app preinstalled is more effective.,Positive,1
4581,Como que eu configuro uma tarefa para ser realizada todas as terças e quartas? Se não é possível fazer isso adicionando apenas uma tarefa precisa melhorar urgentemente,Negative,0
4582,Missing features from Wunderlist. Might need to find a new app.,Negative,0
4583,Wont sync w my crew. I have to cut and paste lists. Wunderlist was seemless,Positive,1
4584,"Widget is horrible. Keeps switching to ""my day"" and won't allow me to change it. Really expected better from Microsoft.",Positive,1
4585,Sync between PC and Android app is very slow! Wunderlist was better. Moving to Google Tasks now. Microsoft ruined a good thing.,Positive,1
4586,The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.,Positive,1
4587,Difficult login forces work or school address. Lost Wunderlist lists as a result,Negative,0
4588,Wunderlist was better,Positive,1
4589,Does not store none tasks information well.,Negative,0
4590,Great app but will have to uninstall if they don't sync with google calendar or include a calendar!,Positive,1
4591,"Widget misbehaves, it keeps switching to ""My day"" and stops reacting to any taps when it does",Negative,0
4592,Thanks for ruining Wunderlist you jackasses,Negative,0
4593,Romantic,Positive,1
4594,Can't sort via categories. Importance level doesn't sync well. Basically syncing problems all around. Creating new lists don't show in Outlook proper.,Positive,1
4595,Doesn't auto add to My Day schedule wise. Repeat reminder doesn't work either.,Positive,1
4596,Missing the widget for iOS A to-do/reminder app is incomplete without a widget. Otherwise 5 stars.,Negative,0
4597,Just like wunderlist except worse !! Laggy update of list from one device to any.,Negative,0
4598,Doesn't sync well with my laptop,Positive,1
4599,Desktop widget stops functioning every minute!!,Negative,0
4600,Widget continues to stop working nothing shows up until I resize it.,Negative,0
4601,This is by far the best To-Do app. I gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use Microsoft Account for sharing the lists.,Positive,1
4602,Completely broken for synch. Wunderlist actually worked. This is a disaster.,Negative,0
4603,"Doesn't allow you to sort completed tasks. I have a single grocery list with 300 tasks in it's completed section that's named by section using tags like ""Produce - onions"". I used to be able to sort completed tasks alphabetically making it easy to have a running list where I could add back frequently purchased items. Now everything is lost automatically placed in completed tasks by completion chronology. Is a pain.",Positive,1
4604,Forced to review to avoid popups every few days. Ok so far,Negative,0
4605,Why widget is not working....???!!!!!,Negative,0
4606,Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password,Positive,1
4607,I m facing the i same issue which kenners79(below comment on 9/6/2020) is facing. Widget issue.,Negative,0
4608,This app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen. They have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists. Might as well just use OneNote now. At lest that is used on my PC too.,Positive,1
4609,UI is good. Easy to use. The only thing that bother me is that the reminder didn't work. That's the basic and important feature of to do app. Missed many task because of this. Please fix it.,Positive,1
4610,App's widget still doesn't react correctly to dark mode changes. I can't see the list often!!,Negative,0
4611,Too complicated,Negative,0
4612,"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works.",Positive,1
4613,The invite user feature is horrible. You can only do it through email as the text option doesn't work. I used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app. I was a user of Wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as I can tell.,Negative,0
4614,Can't use without a MS account. Improved sync. Widget doesn't allow you to chose which list you'd like to see without going into the app.,Positive,1
4615,Failed to arrange my tasks by dragging them as used to do with Wunderlist,Negative,0
4616,Why the comments section is not available yet? As I checked most of users needed it. We had it in wunderlist but here it is not possible to put a comment with recorded date in any list task.,Negative,0
4617,Nice integration with Teams & Planner. Would get an extra star if I could assign tasks directly from To Do.,Positive,1
4618,"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help",Positive,1
4619,I have finally given up with this Application. Although it works ok on its own not being part of Outlook (calendar & mail) on my Andoid phone is a drag. If I put a To Do into my calendar I like to also add it to my to do list but having to run this as a second stand alone app is far from ideal. On my Windows phone it was integrated into Outlook as it is on the PC. Why isn't it part of Outlook?,Positive,1
4620,Another shity microlimp product. They can't even copy a decent app.,Negative,0
4621,Love the app as I am one of the migrated users from Wanderlist but have been a bit disappointed with the following after using To Do: 1. Option to change from Task list to pure check list. 2. Can't install the App on my PC although it is already on my Android phone.,Positive,1
4622,Widgets not working in latest update.,Negative,0
4623,Bring back Wunderlist. My list won't sync with people and I'm having issues.,Negative,0
4624,Widget does not allow you to input to specific lists. Makes for a hassle to open the whole app to add milk to my grocery list.,Positive,1
4625,The notification feature doesn't work for my phone. It's mi note8.,Negative,0
4626,"I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but the app glitches CONSTANTLY with Chrome OS. Whenever I flip to ""My Day,"" the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible. I used it on my Android phone and previously on my Macbook with no problem. I loved the ""My Day"" function and am loathe to switch to a different app, but I don't think I have a choice.",Negative,0
4627,"New update makes ""Planned"" inconvenient. I do like that you can group them now, a much desired thing from wunderlist. But I cant see overdue anymore. Can you please add overdue when viewing ""This Week"". It's inconvenient to flip between categories to see everything on one page.",Positive,1
4628,Where is calender?,Negative,0
4629,A lot worse UX than wunderlist,Negative,0
4630,All of my notifications from a day disappear if I clear one after midnight. What's the point of a to do list that won't allow notifications to persist?,Positive,1
4631,"A new ""feature"" of Microsoft To Do compared to Wunderlist is notifications being cleared at the start of every new day. This is incredibly annoying because if I don't have time to get to it, I want it to be a constant annoying reminder so I know to get around to it. I would rather continue to use Wunderlist, if the recurring tasks was implemented offline, instead of requiring the server to give you a recursive task.",Negative,0
4632,Please add a duedate on sub-step on a task.,Positive,1
4633,Need ability to sort completed tasks.,Positive,1
4634,At first I liked that I could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order. I use this app also as a grocery list. So every time I want to add the done tasks I have to go throw everything. Why can't you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well. Or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves. The way it is now (chaotic) it is very user unfriendly and time consuming.,Negative,0
4635,Migrating from Wunderlist but to be honest with zero integration with google calendar as Wunderlist had...this does not work for me. Off to todoist which has full integration. Really don't understand why you would close Wunderlist before having the same features in ToDo...,Positive,1
4636,"I have down graded my review because ""show completed & hide completed"" features have been removed. Also the ability to edit an item has also disappeared.",Negative,0
4637,REALLY miss Wunderlist. This just feels like a list of work I have to do rather than a list of possibilities from which to choose. To Do is a clunky PC type office app. Wunderlist was a fun life mobile app. I'll be looking for an alternative to To Do.,Positive,1
4638,It was great until the latest release broke most of the useful functionality,Positive,1
4639,Also forced to move from Wunderlist. Im missing the part on my widget where I could see today's tasks but also those for My Week and the overdue tasks as well. Please improve.,Positive,1
4640,Not as good or sleek as wunderlist. I miss wunderlist.,Positive,1
4641,Man!!we cannot have an alarm type alert here...it brings a problem,Negative,0
4642,برنامه خوبیه چون خیالت راحته تو گوشی ذخیره نمیشن. دسته بندیش خوبه ولی نقص داره هنوز. قابلیت بکاپ تو حافظه گوشی نداره. اگه حواست نباشه چیزی پاک کردی قابلیت برگشت نداره. و مقداری نسبت به نسخه کلاسیک مقداری دیر لود میشه.,Negative,0
4643,Reminders sometimes don't work. Especially if set through browser on desktop or if we edit description after setting the reminder.,Negative,0
4644,I really like this app but i dont like microsoft i have gotton locked from this app so many times.,Positive,1
4645,It's not as nice as wunderlist was.,Positive,1
4646,The app is good and useful with great features it has everything that you need for a basic to do list app. but the reason for my 3 stars is that the widget is broken.,Positive,1
4647,"It's extremely limited. There is no natural language processing. Even in English. You can't just type ""buy bread on Monday"" or ""call Max at 9"", which has been a basic features of this class of apps for years. There is only one level of sub-tasks. I wanted to switch to it from Todoist because I'm not a power user and would be happy with a basic app, but it lacks even the basics.",Positive,1
4648,I really can't change notification sound and it uses the same phone notification.,Negative,0
4649,I think that if it was linked to a calender it would be perfect,Positive,1
4650,Back button doesn't shut down application...,Negative,0
4651,Widget doesn't load upon phone restart on samsung S20 FE. It fixes itself once I load the app. Outside of that this is a great app,Positive,1

4660,Thank You :),Positive,1
4661,Good,Positive,1
4662,Please allow me to set due time also instead of just due date,Positive,1
4663,It was working all good until the recent update. I use it on a split screen on a tablet. Previously the left hand side list bar was automatically hidden if the screen is small. Now it always stays which means the task list on the right is impossible to read.,Positive,1
4664,Its very helpful,Positive,1
4665,I like it but it started putting a note icon below each item I add to the list. It makes the item box twice as tall and it's super annoying.,Positive,1
4666,It a decent basic app for what I need. My only current issue is that the height of each task box. Way too much white space on each individual task.,Negative,0
4667,Can it show the schedule into calendar view?,Negative,0
4668,So sad that Wunderlist must gone. Will this one expect the expectation? Why i can't open to do in web browser?!,Negative,0

4681,Decent. It would be good to add custom notifications,Positive,1
4682,Previous versions had more fine grained options in the settings. They made the app really useful. I'd like them back.,Positive,1
4683,App is good. Sticky notes would have make it more usefull,Positive,1
4684,It's good once you figure it out,Positive,1
4685,Latest gripe: Repeating tasks have started appearing on the prior calendar day rather than the proper repeating due day. But not always. Very weird.,Negative,0

4696,I would prefer the ability to sync my tasks with google calendar.,Positive,1
4697,All in Al its a good app but for the last couple of months the reminders aren't working. No push notifications are received. I checked all my permissions for this app and power settings but can't see anything that would prevent it from pushing notifications.. Any ideas?,Positive,1

4714,Meh,Negative,0
4715,"Mediocre Replacement This app is supposed to be taking the place of other list and to do makers, but it does not. This app builds Check-off lists. Nothing more, no matter how they try to dress it up. In the immortal words of Sarah Palin, ""Putting lipstick on a pig...."" This only makes check-off lists. You can't make a list with numbers or dots or dashes. You can't alphabetize it other than having still be a check-off list. Looking for another app. This one truly Microsoft sucks.",Positive,1

4723,Really frustrating that I can't have a unified My Day view for both my work and personal account. It's such a hassle switching accounts.,Negative,0

4726,Good app.,Positive,1

4851,از حیث ابعاد مختلفی کامله، مثل امکان گروه بندی، امکان آپلود فایل، امکان ساخت «ساب تسک»، تنظیم سر رسید، تنظیم یادآور، امکان شیر وعهده‌گذاری کار‌ها به علاوه محیط بسیار کاربر پسند. تنها مشکل اینه برای «ساب‌تسک‌ها» نمی‌توان تاریخ سر رسید و عهده‌گذاری داشت، و میزان و نحوه روند انجام کار امکان نمایش ندارد. * برای دوستان لازم می‌دونم بگم بین محیط ویندوز و اندروید به خوبی همگام سازی میشه و همچنین هر تقویمی که دستگاه روش نصب باشه رو نمایش می‌ده.(یعنی برای ویندوز ۱۰ تقیم کامل جلالی),Negative,0

4902,"O aplicativo é muito bom porém algumas coisas precisam ser melhoradas. Primeiro, deveria ter um opção que você gravasse uma mensagem de voz registrando a tarefa por via de áudio. Segundo, deveria ter uma opção de tarefa não cumprida, um ""x vermelho"" que indica que a tarefa não foi cumprida, porque quando eu registro uma tarefa para ser feita diariamente e algum dia eu não a cumpra, não tem a opção de registrá-la como não feita e enquanto eu não colocá-la como feita o app não põe no dia seguinte.",Negative,0

4930,Wonderful app.,Positive,1
4931,"I use it as the grocery list for when I shop. Everybody in my family used to wait until I was busy doing something else to tell me about what they needed from the store and they would assume that since ""they told me"" that I heard them or retained the information which made for a lot of disappointments. So I shared the app with the family so everybody can add to the list as needed for themselves. As far as my family is concerned, it's a life saver (for them 🙂).",Negative,0

4949,Great app,Positive,1
4950,"For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, ""tomorrow"" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap ""remind me in half an hour"" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",Positive,1

4963,The new update brings a lot that was desired. Most importantly list sharing with much better approach than wunderlist.
